By default, PrestaShop does not capture the real visitor IP when requests pass through a proxy ([more info](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/39190)).  
When Edgee sits in front of PrestaShop, it proxies all traffic, causing PrestaShop to record **Edgee’s IP** instead of the **actual client IP**, which can lead to account access problems.


The module allows PrestaShop to read the real client IP from **forwarded headers**


## Integration Overview

Integrating Edgee with PrestaShop requires **two steps**:

1. **Install the Edgee PrestaShop Module** → lets PrestaShop read the original client IP.
2. **Configure Edgee** → set up Edgee to proxy requests to your PrestaShop store.

> **Important:** Installing the module **alone** does **not** complete the integration.  
> You must also configure Edgee in your [project settings](/getting-started/project-settings).
