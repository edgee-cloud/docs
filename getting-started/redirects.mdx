Redirects allows you to route your traffic from one URL to another, using HTTP status code such as `302 Found` for temporary redirects.
This can be useful when you want to redirect users from an old URL to a new one, for example during a website migration or replatforming.

## How to add new redirect rules

Browse to your project's **Settings** panel and select **Redirects**.
Here, you need to create new `Source -> Target` pairs corresponding to the absolute URLs of your website.

For example, Source: `/homepage` and Target: `/homepage-new`.

Click **Add Redirect** on the right and add as many pairs as you need.

Alternatively, you could upload a CSV file (no headers, 2 columns) to speed up the process.

        dark:hidden
    />
    <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/redirects-dark.png"
        alt="How to add HTTP redirects"
    />
</Frame>


When you are done, don't forget to click **Save redirections**.

If you need to remove an existing redirect pair, simply click on the "-" button next to it and then save again.

<Note>
Please note that propagating your project's settings to all edge nodes might take some time, usually up to a minute or two.
