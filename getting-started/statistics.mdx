You can find your project's monthly statistics on the main project dashboard:

- **Total requests**: they represent the total number of requests: a request is processed every time your visitors perform an
HTTP(s) request through Edgee, including HTML pages, JS/CSS assets, images, and so on.
- **Data Collection events**: they represent the total number of analytics events collected via Edgee: a data collection event
is collected every time your visitors generate an action on your website such as a page view or a custom event like a button click or page scroll.
