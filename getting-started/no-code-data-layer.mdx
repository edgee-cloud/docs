<EdgeeSdk />

The **No-code Data Layer** allows you to filter and transform analytics data on the fly — no engineering effort required. Whether you want to exclude internal traffic or adjust event names, this feature gives you full control over your data without having to write new code.

## What can you do with the No-code Data Layer?

You can:

- **Filter out events** that you don't want to collect.
- **Transform event data** by renaming event names or properties.
- **Define specific rules for each component** (e.g. Google Analytics, PostHog).

One of the most powerful aspects of the No-code Data Layer is that all of this happens without requiring code changes or deployments.

This is perfect when you don’t own the frontend code or just want to test changes quickly.
You can iterate in real time, verify your changes using debugging tools, and fine-tune data delivery to your analytics providers, all from the Edgee dashboard.

## Filter out unwanted events

In some cases, you need to filter out events that you don't want to track on certain analytics platforms.

To do that:

1. Open the **No-code Data Layer** section in your Edgee dashboard.
2. Click **Add Filtering Rule**.
3. Choose a component (e.g. Google Analytics).
4. Set the filtering condition. For example:


<Frame caption="Example of setting up a locale-based filtering rule">
  <img src="/images/setup-filtering-rules.png" alt="Filtering rule configuration based" />
</Frame>


This tells Edgee to **block any event** coming from the `fr-fr` language locale.

<Note>
Please note that propagation is near real-time, but not instantaneous. Wait a few seconds and refresh your debugger to confirm changes.

## Transform event data

You can modify event names and properties on the fly, without needing to update or redeploy your code.

This is especially useful when you need to:

- Standardize naming across multiple destinations.
- Align event names with external schemas.
- Shorten or simplify property keys for consistency.

### Rename an event

Let’s say your frontend sends an event called `button_click`, but your Amplitude component expects it as `click_button`. You can easily adjust this using a data manipulation rule:

1. Go to the **Data Manipulation** tab
2. Click **Rename Track Event**
3. Set the rule:
   - Event name: `button_click`
   - New name: `click_button`
4. Apply the rule to the desired component (e.g. Amplitude)

Now when you inspect the debugger:

- Amplitude receives the renamed `click_button` event.
- All other destinations continue to receive `button_click` event.

<Note>
Each manipulation rule can rename one event name at a time. Create multiple rules if you need to rename multiple events.
</Note>


### Rename a property

You can also rename properties inside your events. For instance, if you want to rename the `category` property to `cat`:

1. Go to the **Data Manipulation** tab
2. Click **Add Manipulation**
3. Set the rule:
   - Property name: `category`
   - New name: `cat`
4. Apply it to the relevant component (e.g. Amplitude)

This change only applies to the `properties` object within `track`, `page`, and `user` events.

<Frame caption="Example of a data manipulation rule to rename an event and its properties.">
  <img src="/images/setup-data-manipulation.png" alt="Data manipulation rule to rename buttonclick to click_button" />
</Frame>

These transformations allow you to experiment, align with external schemas, or clean up your analytics structure — all without ever editing your codebase.

## See it in action

Once your rules are set:

1. Enable debugging by visiting your site with `?_edgeedebug=true`
2. Interact with the page (trigger events)
3. Return to the **Debugging** tab in your Edgee dashboard
4. Inspect your events — they’ll reflect any filtering or transformation rules applied

Use the **Details** view to see exactly what was sent to each component.

<Note>
This view can expose internal values like IPs or API keys — please only share screenshots with trusted teammates.

## Summary

With Edgee’s No-code Data Layer, you can:

- Filter out unwanted events like internal traffic
- Rename and reshape event data to match your schemas
- Apply changes per component (e.g. different naming for PostHog vs Google Analytics)
- Test and debug everything in real-time
