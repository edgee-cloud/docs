<EdgeeSdk />

The **No-code Data Layer** in Edgee allows you to filter and transform analytics data on the fly — no engineering effort required. Whether you want to exclude internal traffic or adjust event names to match a schema, this feature gives you powerful control over your data without needing to redeploy.

## What can you do with the No-code Data Layer?

You can:

- **Filter out events** that you don't want to track
- **Transform event data** by renaming event names or properties
- **Apply changes per destination** (e.g. Google Analytics, PostHog)

One of the most powerful aspects of the No-code Data Layer is that all of this happens without requiring code changes or deployments.

This is perfect when:

- You don’t own the frontend code
- You want to test changes quickly

You can iterate in real time, test using debugging tools, and fine-tune data delivery to your analytics providers — all from the Edgee dashboard.

## Filter out unwanted events

In some cases, you might want to filter out events that you don't want to track on certain destinations.

To do that:

1. Open the **No-code Data Layer** section in your Edgee dashboard.
2. Click **Add Filtering Rule**.
3. Choose a destination (e.g. Google Analytics).
4. Set the filtering condition. For example:


<Frame caption="Example of setting up a locale-based filtering rule">
  <img src="/images/setup-filtering-rules.png" alt="Filtering rule configuration based" />
</Frame>


This tells Edgee to **block any event** coming from the fr-fr language locale.


<Note>
Propagation is near real-time, but not instantaneous. Wait a few seconds and refresh your debugger to confirm changes.

## Transform event data

## Rename events and properties — without touching code

With the **No-code Data Layer**, you can modify event names and properties on the fly, without needing to update or redeploy your code.

This is especially useful when you need to:

- Standardize naming across multiple destinations
- Align event names with external schemas
- Shorten or simplify property keys for consistency

### Rename an event

Let’s say your frontend sends an event called `button_click`, but a destination like Amplitude expects it as `click_button`. You can easily adjust this using a data manipulation rule:

1. Go to the **Data Manipulation** tab
2. Click **Rename Track Event**
3. Set the rule:
   - Event name: `button_click`
   - New name: `click_button`
4. Apply the rule to the desired destination (e.g. Amplitude)

Now when you inspect the debugger:

- Amplitude receives the renamed `click_button` event
- All other destinations continue to receive `button_click` as-is

<Note>
Each manipulation rule can rename one event name at a time. Create multiple rules if you need to rename multiple events.
</Note>


### Rename a property

You can also rename properties inside your events. For instance, if you want to rename the `category` property to `cat`:

1. Go to the **Data Manipulation** tab
2. Click **Add Manipulation**
3. Set the rule:
   - Property name: `category`
   - New name: `cat`
4. Apply it to the relevant destination (e.g. Amplitude)

This change only applies to the `properties` object within `track`, `page`, and `user` events.

<Frame caption="Example of a data manipulation rule to rename an event and its properties.">
  <img src="/images/setup-data-manipulation.png" alt="Data manipulation rule to rename buttonclick to click_button" />
</Frame>

These transformations allow you to experiment, align with external schemas, or clean up your analytics structure — all without ever editing your codebase.

## See it in action

Once your rules are set:

1. Enable debugging by visiting your site with `?_edgeedebug=true`
2. Interact with the page (trigger events)
3. Return to the **Debugging** tab in your Edgee dashboard
4. Inspect your events — they’ll reflect any filtering or transformation rules applied

Use the **Details** view to see exactly what was sent to each destination.

<Note>
This view can expose internal values like IPs or API keys — please only share screenshots with trusted teammates.

- Rename and reshape event data to match your schemas
- Apply changes per provider (e.g. different naming for PostHog vs Google Analytics)
- Test and debug everything in real-time

No deploys. No dependencies. Just full control over your analytics data.
