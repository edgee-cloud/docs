<EdgeeSdk />

An Edgee project is an edge computing application, that operates across all 
our [available edge locations](/introduction/network-map). 

Each service within your project is rapidly propagated to all our 
Points of Presence (PoPs) around the world, ensuring changes take effect in seconds.

## Creating a new Project

To create a new project, use the top-left menu and click **Create project**.

### Step 1: Configure your Project

Your project name serves as a unique identifier and will be part 
of your project's URL. Optionally, add a description to help you and your team remember the project's purpose.

  <img
    src="/images/create-project-1.png"
    alt="Create a project, step 1"
    align={"center"}
  />
</Frame>

<Warning>
  **Can I add my own URL?**<br/>
  Yes of course, don't worry! We'll get there after step 3.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Set up the first routing rules

Edgee acts as a reverse proxy, meaning it receives requests and directs them to designated 
origin based on your routing rules.

    alt="Create a project, step 2"
    align={"center"}
  />
</Frame>

Let's set up your first routing rule:

1. Select the protocol (`HTTP` or `HTTPS`) by clicking on the protocol field.
2. Enter the address of your website. It can be either a hostname or an IP address (v4 or v6).

  src="/images/address.png"
  alt="Address field"
  align={"center"}
/>

Beneath the address field, you find an accordion for advanced routing options. 
For detailed guidance on all available routing options and advanced rules, please visit our [routing rules documentation](/getting-started/routing).

### Step 3: Project propagation

Congratulations! Your project is now configured and is being propagated across our 
edge network. We have automatically assigned an **.edgee.app** domain to your project. 
Use this domain to test and ensure your project is functioning as expected.

  />
</Frame>

<Warning>
  **Create a dedicated project for each environment**<br/>
  We strongly recommend to create a dedicated project for each environments (prod, staging, dev) to avoid issues in production while experimenting.

## Next steps

#### Configure custom routing rules _(optional)_

Routing settings are used to specify how Edgee should handle routing for your project.
To create custom routes, navigate to the **Settings** panel in your project dashboard and select **Routing**.

To know more about how to set up new rules, you can read the [routing documentation](/getting-started/routing).


#### Adding Your Own Domain _(optional)_

You can associate multiple domains to your project and Edgee will take care of generating certificates and handling the renewal process.
To add or edit domains, navigate to the **Domains** card in your project dashboard.

To know more about how to set up a domain, you can read the [domains documentation](/getting-started/domains).

#### Integrate the Edgee SDK

Once your domain is set up, the final step is to [integrate the Edgee SDK](/getting-started/sdk) into your website.
