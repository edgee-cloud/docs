import EdgeeSdk from '/snippets/edgee-sdk.mdx';

After [setting up a project](/getting-started/project-settings),
[installing the SDK](/getting-started/sdk),
and [activating your data collection components](/services/data-collection/overview),
you might wonder if everything's working smoothly on your website. 
We understand it might be tricky to verify since you cannot see any tracking request from the browser anymore.

That's why we've built a dedicated debugging capability that allows you to inspect a live stream of events while
they're being collected and sent to analytics destinations from your website.

Just a few things to note before you get started with debugging:

1. Debugging needs to be explicitly enabled.
2. All debugging events are stored only temporarily so you can inspect and debug potential issues,
then all the data is deleted automatically.
3. Debugging only applies to a single user at a time (yourself), not every visitor on your website;
this keeps things efficient and lets you inspect exactly the events you need without being flooded 
with thousands of events from everyone else.

Let's have a look at how it works in detail.

## Enable debugging for your project

After you've activated at least one data collection component, a new **Debug** button will appear on 
your project's **Data Collection** panel.


<Frame caption="Where to find the debugging page for your project. Click on the image to zoom in.">
    <img
        className="block dark:hidden"
        src="/images/debugging-button.png"
        alt="Where to find the debugging page for your project"
        dark:hidden
    />
    <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/debugging-button-dark.png"
        alt="Where to find the debugging page for your project"
    />
</Frame>

Here you'll find an interactive page where all your debug events will appear.

But first, you need to enable debugging for your project.
This is required because by default Edgee doesn't store any of your analytics data.
To enable debugging, just visit your website with `?_edgeedebug=true` in query string.

No worries, you will find a direct link to your project's homepage with that special query string already configured.
Something like `https://your-project-id.edgee.app?_edgeedebug=true`.

Please note that:
- This only works if you visit a page where the Edgee SDK is correctly installed. In the rare case where 
the Edgee SDK is not installed on your homepage, please visit another page with the same query string.
- This will enable the collection of debugging events only for yourself (not for all the users browsing your website). 
If you need a complete overview of how many events are being collected on your website in total, check out your 
[project statistics](/getting-started/statistics).

## Inspect debugging events

As you start browing on your Edgee-powered website with enabled debugging, new events will start to appear on this page.

Click on each event to open and review its details, so you can inspect the corresponding data and context.

    <img
        className="block dark:hidden"
        src="/images/debugging-events.png"
        alt="How to inspect debugging events"
        dark:hidden
    />
    <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/debugging-events-dark.png"
        alt="How to inspect debugging events"
    />
</Frame>

In addition, depending on which components are enabled for your project, you'll see a list of one (or more) 
*Component Events*. These are the actual data collection events that Edgee has sent to the analytics destinations.

Click **Details** to visualize the detailed request and response headers for each component event.

  Measurement IDs or API keys. We recommend sharing links or screenshots only with your dev team and trusted partners.
