Edgee can sit in front of your HubSpot CMS as a proxy to **boost performance**, **strengthen security**, and **seamless integration**.


<Note>
For HubSpot’s full technical documentation, see [Use a reverse proxy with HubSpot](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/cms/content/performance/reverse-proxy-support).

## Edgee Setup Overview

Integrating Edgee with HubSpot involves four main steps:

1. **Configure Edgee** – point Edgee to your HubSpot origin URL (e.g., `https://123456.group15.sites.hubspot.net`).  
2. **Create Secret Headers in Edgee** – forward headers so HubSpot recognizes requests correctly.  
3. **Connect or update your domain in HubSpot** – register the domain and disable HubSpot’s built-in CDN.
4. **Update your DNS to route through Edgee** – ensure all traffic flows to Edgee first, then securely to HubSpot.



### Step 1 — Connect Your Domain to Edgee

<Note>See [Custom Domains](/getting-started/domains) for detailed instructions on configuring domains with Edgee.</Note>

1. Log in to your **Edgee** dashboard.  
2. Go to **Project Settings → Routing**.  
3. Click **Create New Route** and configure the following:
   - Configure **Origin URL**, **Host Override**, **SNI**, and **Cert Hostname** with the same `https://<HubID>.<group>.sites.hubspot.net` domain (e.g. `nhttps://123456.group15.sites.hubspot.net`).
4. Save and activate your configuration.  


### Step 2 — Create Secret Headers in Edgee

1. In Edgee, go to **Security → Secret Headers**.  
2. Add the following headers so HubSpot accepts and processes requests correctly:  

- **Header name** → `X-HS-Public-Host`  
  **Header value** → `www.mydomain.com` (the domain pointing to your site)  

- **Header name** → `X-HubSpot-Trust-Forwarded-For`  
  **Header value** → `true`  

3. Save the header configuration.

### Step 3 — Connect the Domain in HubSpot

1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings → Content → Domains & URLs**.  
2. Click **Connect a domain**.  
3. Choose the type (Primary, Secondary, or Redirect) and select which content types you’ll host.  
4. Disable HubSpot built-in CDN Configuration - **Toggle OFF**:  
This ensures HubSpot does not manage SSL or CDN — Edgee will handle it instead.

5. Follow HubSpot’s prompts to verify and complete the setup.  


### Step 4 — Point Your Domain to Edgee

1. Update your DNS settings so your domain routes traffic through **Edgee** instead of directly to HubSpot.  
2. Follow the [Edgee Routing Guide](/getting-started/routing) to complete the configuration.

With this setup, Edgee sits in front of HubSpot to deliver faster performance, enhanced security, and seamless integration—while HubSpot continues to power your content and publishing workflow.
