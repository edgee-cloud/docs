Edgee Organizations allow you to manage users and their roles to collaborate on projects.

By default, when you create a new organization, you are the only user with the **Admin** role.
You can invite other users to your organization and assign them different roles, such as **Member** or **Editor**.

### User roles and permissions

When you invite a new user to your organization or change the role of an existing user,
you can assign them one of the following roles:

| Role       | Permissions                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Admin**  | Full access to all projects and settings. Can invite and manage users.      |
| **Editor** | Can add components to projects, but cannot create projects or manage users. |
| **Member** | Read-only access.                                                           |
