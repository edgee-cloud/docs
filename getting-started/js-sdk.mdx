<EdgeeSdk />

Copy the snippet below, then add it to your HTML document - ideally just before the closing `</head>` tag.

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_SDK__" src="<YOUR_SDK_URL>" async></script>
```

Replace `<YOUR_SDK_URL>` with the URL provided in the Edgee console, in the project overview section.

<Tip>If your immediate need is just a basic Google Analytics setup, then congratulations! 
  Your integration journey ends here. 
  Simply activate Google Analytics in the Edgee console, and you're all set.</Tip>
