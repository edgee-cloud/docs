Edgee can act as a proxy in front of your Vercel project to **improve performance**, **enhance security**, and **simplify integrations**.
This setup ensures all traffic flows through Edgee first, while Vercel continues to serve your content.

3. Ensure routing settings are correctly configured


### Step 1 — Get Your Vercel Domain

2. Copy your project’s default domain (e.g., `myapp.vercel.app` or `nextjs-boilerplate-abc1234.vercel.app`).

   - Configure **Origin URL**, **Host Override**, **SNI**, and **Cert Hostname** with the same `.vercel.app` domain (e.g. `nextjs-boilerplate-abc1234.vercel.app`).
4. Click **Save** and **Activate** to apply your routing configuration.
