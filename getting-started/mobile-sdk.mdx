### React Native SDK Features

Our React Native SDK provides:

- **Rich Native Context**: Automatically collects device, app, and system information
- **Privacy-First**: GDPR/CCPA compliant with optional device ID collection
- **Offline Queue**: Events are persisted and retried when network is available
- **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on app size (~100KB total)
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Auto Screen Tracking**: Optional helpers for Expo Router and React Navigation
- **Graceful Fallback**: Works without native modules (Expo Go compatible)

## Native iOS and Android SDKs

We're currently working on native mobile SDKs for iOS and Android that will provide even deeper system integration.

In the meantime, you can directly integrate with the data collection API of your Edgee project for native iOS and Android apps.
