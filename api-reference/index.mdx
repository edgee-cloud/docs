Welcome to the Edgee API documentation. This guide will help you understand how to interact with the Edgee API to create, 
retrieve, update, and delete Edgee resources through HTTP requests.


## Base URL

All URLs referenced in the documentation have the following base:

```
https://api.edgee.ai
```

## Authentication

The Edgee API uses bearer authentication. When making requests, you must include your API token in the `Authorization` 
header in the format `Bearer <token>`. For more details, please refer to the [Authentication](./authentication) page.

## Errors

When an error occurs, the Edgee API responds with a conventional HTTP response code and a JSON object containing more 
details about the error. For more information, please refer to the [Errors](./errors) page.

## Rate Limiting

Please note that the Edgee API has rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure service stability. If you exceed these limits, 
your requests will be throttled and you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
