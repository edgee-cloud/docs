title: 'ApiToken endpoints'
description: 'ApiToken endpoints allow you to create, list, get and delete ApiTokens.'

As explained in the [authentication documentation](./api-reference/authentication), Edgee API uses API tokens to 
authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API tokens in the [Console](https://console.edgee.cloud/settings/api-tokens), 
but you can also create and manage API tokens using the API itself.

A token is a string that you can use to authenticate requests to the Edgee API. Tokens are similar to passwords. 
As a result, you should treat them with the same level of care. Do not share your token with anyone, including
Edgee support. If you believe your token has been compromised, you can regenerate a new one at any time.
