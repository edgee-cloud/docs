import EdgeeSdk from '/snippets/edgee-sdk.mdx';

<EdgeeSdk />

This guide will help you understand how to interact with the Data Collection API to 
collect events at the edge.

Please note that the Data Collection API is used automatically by the Edgee SDK, but could also
be used directly for other purposes, such as custom mobile integrations.


## Base URL

The data collection API is special because it is project-specific:

```
https://{PROJECT_ID}.edgee.app
```

You can find your project's ID on the [Edgee dashboard](https://www.edgee.cloud/~/me) under each project.
The API domain corresponds to your Edgee SDK domain:

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_SDK__" async src="https://{PROJECT_ID}.edgee.app/_edgee/sdk.js"></script>
```

## Authentication

The Data Collection API is meant for your client-side devices to use both for
logged-in and anonymous users, so it doesn't require any authentication.

## Data structures

Please refer to the [Edgee Data Layer docs](/services/data-collection/data-layer) to learn more about the events and context fields.

## Debugging

To enable [debugging](/getting-started/debugging) via API you'll need to include a `_edgeedebug=true` cookie
in your requests.

For example:

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl {4}
curl --request POST \
  --url https://{project_id}.edgee.app/_edgee/event \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --cookie '_edgeedebug=true' \
  --data '...'
```

```python python {6}
import requests
url = "https://{project_id}.edgee.app/_edgee/event"
payload = {...}
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "cookie": "_edgeedebug=true",
}
response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)
```

```javascript JavaScript {5}
const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'cookie': '_edgeedebug=true',
  },
  body: '...'
};
fetch('https://{project_id}.edgee.app/_edgee/event', options)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Errors

When an error occurs, the Edgee API responds with a conventional HTTP response code and a JSON object containing more 
details about the error. For more information, please refer to the [Errors](../errors) page.
