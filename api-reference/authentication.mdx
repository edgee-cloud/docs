description: "How to authenticate to the Edgee API"
---

The Edgee API uses API tokens to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API token in the
Edgee [Console](https://console.edgee.cloud/settings/api-tokens).

Your API tokens carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your tokens in
publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your API token as the basic auth username value.
You do not need to provide a password.

If you need to authenticate via bearer auth (e.g., for a cross-origin request),
use `-H "Authorization: Bearer {{token}}"` instead of `-u {{token}}:`.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication
will also fail.

<RequestExample>
  
  ```bash Authenticated cURL Request
  curl 'https://api.edgee.app/v1/projects' \
  -u '<token>:'
  # The colon prevents curl from asking for a password.
  ```
  
  ```bash cURL with Bearer
  curl 'https://api.edgee.app/v1/projects' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
  ```
