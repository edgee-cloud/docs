### Parameters

<ResponseField name="limit" type="int" optional>
  The number of Organizations to return. The default is 10.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string">
  This is the name of your Organization. It is used to filter the list of Organization by name.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="ending_before" type="datetime">
  A cursor for use in pagination. 
  
  `ending_before` parameter defines the place in the list for your subsequent calls.
  For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 Organizations, the last one (the oldest) 
  having `2023-02-20T00:00:00Z` as its creation date, you can make a subsequent call
  with `ending_before=2023-02-20T00:00:00Z` in order to fetch the next page of the list.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="starting_after" type="datetime">
  A cursor for use in pagination. 
  
  `starting_after` parameter defines the place in the list for your subsequent calls.
  For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 Organizations, the first one (the newest) 
  having `2023-02-20T00:00:00Z` as its creation date, you can make a subsequent call
  with `starting_after=2023-02-20T00:00:00Z` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="order_direction" type="string">
  The order direction of the returned list. 
  
  The Organizations are returned sorted by creation date. By default, the order is descending, so the most recent Organizations appear first.
  Possible values are `ASC` and `DESC`. 
  Default is `DESC`.
</ResponseField>

### Response

A dictionary with a data property that contains an array of up to limit Organizations. 
Passing an optional `name` will search for Organizations with this name. 
Passing an optional `type` will search for Organizations with this type.
Each entry in the array is a separate Organization object. If no more Organizations are available, the resulting array will be empty.

`has_more` property indicates whether there are more Organizations available. You can use it to decide whether to show the 
user a "load more" button, for example.
