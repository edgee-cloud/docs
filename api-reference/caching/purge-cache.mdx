When you purge cache, Edgee will remove the specified cached content from all edge locations worldwide, which is useful when you need to update cached content, clear stale data after deployments, force fresh content to be served to users, or troubleshoot caching issues. 

Query strings are automatically removed from the path before purging and cache is purged for all domains associated with the project across all edge locations worldwide.
