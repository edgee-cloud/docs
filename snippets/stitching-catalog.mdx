Edgee's Stitching components enable dynamic content modification directly at the edge. 
These powerful components combine data collection with HTML/JS injection capabilities, allowing you to modify and personalize content 
before it reaches your users. 

By handling content changes at the edge, Stitching components boost web performance and prevent third-party scripts from being 
blocked by browsers or ad blockers. This makes them particularly effective for use cases like A/B testing, where seamless content variations are essential.
