  Note: the Edgee CLI is intended to simplify and make local development uniform across programming languages and component types.
  
  While some of the compiling details are still visible today because of long multi-step commands or additional support scripts,
  our long-term goal is to hide most of that complexity behind `edgee components build` in the future.

  For example, you need to explicitly configure debug flags for your preferred language:
  
  - Rust components use `cargo build --release` by default,
  but you can enable debugging symbols by removing the `--release` flag from the build command in your manifest file.
  (Please note that this will increase the size of your Wasm file considerably, up to 40x)
  - C components use `clang` to compile the Wasm file with the `-Os` flag by default,
  but you can change this to `-O0` in your manifest file.
  - Go components include debug symbols by default, but you can add the `-no-debug` flag to disable them and optimize
  the size and performance of your Wasm file.
