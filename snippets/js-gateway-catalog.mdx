Edgee’s JS Gateway components allow you to proxy and optimize **JavaScript SDKs** from analytics and marketing tools through your own domain.
These gateways improve resilience against ad blockers, improve performance, and ensure better data collection, even under strict browser policies.

These components securely inject JavaScript SDKs into your pages through your main domain, proxying all SDK calls through edge-optimized paths. 
This architecture makes the SDKs highly resilient against browser restrictions (like Safari's ITP) and ad blockers, while maintaining full JavaScript functionality. 

While still leveraging JavaScript, these gateways boost SDK reliability and performance by handling critical operations at the edge. 
They're particularly effective for platforms like Meta, Google, and Piano that support hybrid or server-side approaches.
