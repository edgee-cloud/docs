Endpoint components allow developers to deploy lightweight HTTP microservices directly at the edge without standing up new backend infrastructure.
They're perfect for things like IP-based geolocation or storing small key-value pairs used at runtime.

When configuring an endpoint component, you'll need to specify a URL path pattern that determines when the component is activated. 
For example, you might configure the geolocation component to respond to requests at `/apigeo`. 
This gives you full control over your API routing while keeping the implementation simple and declarative.

Fast, serverless, and deployed in seconds - just configure your desired path and the component handles the rest.
