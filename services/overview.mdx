<EdgeeSdk />

Edgee has developed a new approach to deliver services at the edge and acting as an app store for edge computing platforms.
All our functionalities inherit and adapt to the project configuration you have in place.

Our platform offers two distinct end-users identification modes, **cookieless** and **cookie-based**, allowing you to choose 
the solution that best aligns with your privacy requirements and technical needs.

### Cookieless Mode
When user consent is pending or denied, Edgee operates in cookieless mode:
- **Temporary Identification**: Uses a 24-hour temporary hash based on non-unique identifiers
- **Edge-Only Storage**: Data is stored exclusively in Edgee's edge cache
- **No Browser Storage**: No cookies or local storage are used
- **Limited Tracking**: Prevents long-term user tracking across sessions

### Cookie-Based Mode
Edgee can also utilize a first-party encrypted cookie that does not require user consent when used strictly for audience measurement.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Provides more precise user identification
- **Session Continuity**: Enables better tracking of user journeys
- **Encrypted Storage**: Cookie contents are encrypted and readable only by Edgee
- **Dynamic Regeneration**: Cookie is regenerated with each request for enhanced security


We strongly encourage each customer to assess their specific legal obligations and risk posture, 
and to select the user identification mode, cookieless or cookie-based, that best aligns with their compliance strategy and consent requirements.

For detailed information about our privacy practices and compliance framework, please refer to our [Privacy Documentation](/introduction/privacy).


## Our services

### Component registry

The Component Registry enables developers to publish, share, and reuse WebAssembly-powered components on Edgee:

- **Public Components**: Open source developers can create components available to all Edgee projects
- **Private Components**: Organizations can build custom components for internal or customer use
- **Open Source Integration**: Pull public components into self-hosted Edgee deployments
- **Developer Tools**: CLI tools for creating, building, and managing components

The registry supports both public sharing of components and private development for enterprise needs, 
making it easy to extend Edgee's capabilities with custom integrations and APIs.

### Consent Management

Edgee provides flexible consent management options to help you respect user privacy choices:

- **SDK Integration**: Direct consent management through the Edgee JavaScript SDK
- **CMP Integration**: Seamless integration with popular Consent Management Platforms (Axeptio, Didomi, OneTrust, CookieYes)
- **Consent Status Control**: Three possible states (pending, denied, granted) with appropriate data handling for each

### Data Collection

Edgee's Data Collection service enables you to run your analytics solutions:

- **Edge Processing**: Analytics events are captured and processed at the edge, eliminating client-side delays and data loss
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with major analytics platforms (Google Analytics, Amplitude) and custom solutions
- **Bot Detection**: Proprietary challenge mechanism ensures only real human traffic is tracked
- **Automatic Capture**: Automatically captures page events once the Edgee SDK is integrated

The service combines edge computing with client-side capabilities through our SDK to deliver accurate analytics while maintaining optimal performance.

### Edge Functions

Edge Functions enable you to deploy custom logic that executes at specific paths on your domain:

- **Path-Based Execution**: Functions trigger when users visit configured paths or path prefixes
- **Custom Responses**: Generate dynamic content, APIs, and custom logic directly at the edge
- **Zero Backend Dependency**: Serve responses without backend server involvement
- **Global Distribution**: Execute from edge locations closest to your users for minimal latency

When a client makes a request to the configured path, your edge function executes and returns a custom response, enabling serverless functionality at the edge.

### Security

By deploying edge-native security measures, you protect your applications from a multitude of threats before they can reach your core infrastructure. 
From DDoS mitigation to bot management and data encryption, Edgee offers a robust shield for your digital assets, all while maintaining peak performance.

- **DDoS Protection**: Guard against volumetric attacks that aim to disrupt your service availability.
- **Bot Management**: Keep malicious bots at bay while ensuring legitimate users have uninterrupted access.
- **Data Encryption**: Safeguard sensitive information with encryption protocols that meet the highest standards of security.
