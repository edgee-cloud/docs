Edgee lets you safeguard your website using several powerful methods, 
simply by navigating to **Access Control** from the **Security settings** of your project.

### Password Protection

This feature requires all visitors to enter a predefined password before accessing your website,
adding a layer of security that protects your content from unauthorized access.

</Frame>


### Required Header

Require a specific header to be present in the request to your site or app.
If the header is not present, the request will be blocked.

    align={"center"}

</Frame>

### Trusted IPs

Enhance security by allowing access only from known, trusted IP addresses.
This setting ensures that only visitors from specified IPs can reach your application, effectively blocking unwanted or potentially harmful traffic.

    align={"center"}

</Frame>

### Blocked IPs

Conversely, you can specify IP addresses that are denied access to your website.
This is useful for preventing access from known problematic sources and maintaining public accessibility without exposing your site to certain risks.
