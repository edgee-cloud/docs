- **Service Recognition**: Identify specific AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, etc.)
- **Traffic Patterns**: Understand when and how often AI systems visit your site

### Traffic Analytics
- **Volume Tracking**: Monitor the volume of AI traffic over time
- **Content Analysis**: See which pages and content AI access most
- **Bandwidth Impact**: Understand the infrastructure cost of AI traffic

### Advanced Insights
- **Crawling Behavior**: Analyze how different AI navigate your site
- **Content Preferences**: Identify what type of content attracts AI crawlers
- **Traffic Impact**: Understand the volume and patterns of AI visits
