<EdgeeSdk />

Native Cookie Support is a powerful feature that allows Edgee to manage analytics cookies directly at the edge, 
allowing you to maintain consistent user identification between Edgee and the analytics platform's JS SDK.

This feature is particularly useful when you're using both the Google Analytics client-side JavaScript SDK and Edgee's Google Analytics component simultaneously, as it ensures consistent user tracking across both implementations.

This feature is only available for [Google Analytics](/components/data-collection/google-analytics), [Amplitude](/components/data-collection/amplitude) and [Piano Analytics](/components/data-collection/piano-analytics) for now.

## How It Works

When enabled, Edgee manages analytics cookies at the edge:

1. For new visitors, Edgee generates unique identifiers and sets the appropriate cookies
2. For returning visitors, Edgee reads the existing identifiers from cookies
3. These identifiers are automatically included in all events sent to your analytics platforms

<Note>
   Be careful, with this feature, Edgee is able to unify user ID across JS SDK and Edgee's component, **but it's not able to unify user sessions**.
   Using this feature could lead to duplicate user sessions in your analytics platforms.
</Note>

## Configuration

You can control native cookie behavior through the compatible component settings with four modes:

<Frame caption="Go to your project > Data Collection > Your component, then configure the Native Cookie Support (if available).">
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/native-cookie-support-light.png"/>
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/native-cookie-support-dark.png"/>
</Frame>

- **disabled**: Native cookie support is turned off (default)
- **safe**: Cookies are only set after user consent is explicitly granted
- **strong**: Cookies are set unless user explicitly denies consent
- **always**: Cookies are set regardless of consent status

<Warning>
  Using `strong` or `always` modes may not comply with privacy regulations in your jurisdiction (such as GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable laws). 
  By enabling these modes, you assume full responsibility for:
  - Ensuring compliance with all applicable privacy laws and regulations
  - Obtaining and managing necessary user consents
  - Implementing appropriate privacy notices and policies
  - Any legal consequences resulting from non-compliant cookie usage

  Edgee provides these features as technical capabilities only. We strongly recommend consulting with your legal team or privacy experts before implementing these modes.
</Warning>

## Supported Platforms

Native Cookie Support is available for the following analytics platforms:

- **Amplitude**: Manages the `AMP_[API_KEY]` device ID cookie
- **Google Analytics**: Manages the `_ga` client ID cookie
- **Piano Analytics**: Manages various cookies based on configuration (`atid`, `_pcid`, `atuserid`)

Each platform's documentation includes specific details about their cookie implementation and configuration options.
