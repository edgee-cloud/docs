The `page` event lets you record whenever a user visits a page, along with any optional properties about the page.
Each time Edgee collects a `page` event, it sends the data to the analytics components you've previously set up in your Edgee project.

## Event fields

The `page` event collects several fields about the page:

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---
`name` | String | The name of the page
`category` | String | The category of the page
`title` | String | The title of the page
`url` | String | The full url of the page, with scheme, host, path, and search
`path` | String | The path of the page
`search` | String | The search query of the page
`keywords` | Array | The keywords associated with the page
`properties` | Object | Free-form dictionary of properties of the page


## How to collect the `page` event?

### 1 - Automatically

If you followed the [Data Collection Highlights](/services/data-collection/overview), 
you've already installed the [Edgee SDK](/getting-started/sdk) on your website.

Once you've installed it, Edgee collects the `page` event for each page viewed,
setting the values of the above fields from the HTTP request or DOM. 

For React applications, once you have successfully installed the [React-Edgee](/getting-started/react-sdk) SDK, no further action is required. 
This library ensures seamless integration of Edgee’s services and accurate tracking of page views during SPA navigations.

### 2 - Manually

In some cases, manually triggering the `page` event is necessary to accurately collect user movements across different views. 
Edgee’s SDK facilitates this through the `edgee.page()` method, allowing developers to send `page` events with custom data 
whenever a user navigates to a new part of the application. 

Here’s an example of how to manually trigger a `page` event:

```js
window.addEventListener('edgee:loaded', function(){
    edgee.page();
});
```

## Edgee Data Layer

You can manually specify each field by writing what we call a JSON **Data Layer** in your page.

Here is an example of how to insert a **Data Layer**:

<CodeGroup>
```html HTML page
<script id="__EDGEE_DATA_LAYER__" type="application/json">
{
  "data_collection": {
    "events": [
      {
        "type": "page",
        "data": {
          "name": "welcome-page",
          "category": "welcome",
          "title": "Hello world!",
          "url": "https://www.example.com/welcome.html"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
</script>
```

```jsx ReactJS page
// import the necessary components
import { EdgeeDataLayer, EdgeeDataLayerObject } from "react-edgee";

// declare your data layer object
const edgeeDataLayer: EdgeeDataLayerObject = {
  "data_collection": {
    "events": [
      {
        "type": "page",
        "data": {
          name: "welcome-page",
          category: "welcome",
          title: "Hello world!",
          url: "https://www.example.com/welcome.html"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}


// add the EdgeeDataLayer component where you want to render it
return (
  <EdgeeDataLayer data={edgeeDataLayer} />
);
```

</CodeGroup>

In this example, we've specified the `name`, `category`, `title`, and `url` fields for the `page` event.
Edgee will use this information to enrich the data collected for each page view, providing a more detailed view of user interactions on your website.

To know more about the **Data Layer** capabilities, check the [dedicated documentation](/services/data-collection/data-layer).

## Fields gathering

In case you don't specify a Data Layer, here's how Edgee gathers the page information:

Field | Type | Field definition order
----- | ---- | --------------------------
`name` | String | `data layer`, or by the page's `title` tag
`category` | String | This field is only defined by the `data layer`
`title` | String | `data layer`, or by the page's `title` tag
`url` | String | `data layer`, or the `canonical` tag, or the `http request`
`path` | String | `data layer`, or the `http request`
`search` | String | `data layer`, or the `http request`
`keywords` | Array | `data layer`, or the `keywords` meta tag
`properties` | Object | Free-form dictionary of properties, only defined by the `data layer`

Feel free to choose the best way to specify the `page` event fields, but remember that the **Data Layer** is the most powerful way to do it.

## Control the destinations of the events

If for some reason you don't want to send the `page` event to all the components you've set up in your Edgee project,
you can specify the components that will receive the event data in the **Data Layer**.

<CodeGroup>
```html HTML page
<script id="__EDGEE_DATA_LAYER__" type="application/json">
{
  "data_collection": {
    "events": [
      {
        "type": "page",
        "data": {
          "name": "welcome-page",
          "category": "welcome",
          "title": "Hello world!",
          "url": "https://www.example.com/welcome.html"
        },
        "components": {
          "google_analytics": true,
          "amplitude": false
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
</script>
```
  
```jsx ReactJS page
<EdgeeDataLayer data={
  "data_collection": {
    "events": [
      {
        "type": "page",
        "data": {
          "name": "welcome-page",
          "category": "welcome",
          "title": "Hello world!",
          "url": "https://www.example.com/welcome.html"
        },
        "components": {
          "google_analytics": true,
          "amplitude": false
        }
      }
    ]
  }
} />
```
  
</CodeGroup>

If the components parameter is not specified, Edgee will look at `data_collection.components` in the **Data Layer**. 
If not defined, the event will be sent to all your components.

## More about manual triggering

Edgee automatically collects `page` event when a page is called, but in some cases, you may need to manually trigger the `page` event.

If you call the `edgee.page()` method without any parameters, Edgee will use the [fields gathering](#fields-gathering) we've seen before.
But to avoid having to change the **Data Layer** every time you manually call `edgee.page()`, you can specify the fields directly in the method,
which will have the effect of overloading field gathering.

Here is an example of a complete `edgee.page()` call:

```javascript
// Syntax: edgee.page(pageObj, components);
edgee.page({
    "name": "page-name",
    "category": "my-category",
    "title": "Hello world!",
    "url": "https://www.example.com/welcome.html",
    "path": "/welcome.html",
    "search": "?utm_source=google",
    "keywords": ["hello", "world"],
    "properties": {
        "section": "political"
    }
}, {
    "google_analytics": true,
    "amplitude": true
});
```

The `edgee.page()` method expect two optionals parameters:
Field |    | Type | Description
----- | -- | ---- | ---
`pageObj` | _optional_ | Object\|String | A dictionary object containing details of the `page` event. This object can include all the following optional fields: `name`, `category`, `title`, `url`, `path`, `search`, `keywords`, and `properties`. You can also provide a string that will be used as the `name` field.
`components` | _optional_ | Object | Specifies which analytics components should receive the event data. This allows for targeted data sending based on your configured components within the Edgee platform.


## Privacy by design

At Edgee, we prioritize user privacy and the protection of personal data. Our approach to handling `page` event data is designed to 
respect user privacy by default, ensuring data is anonymized and processed in compliance with stringent data protection standards.

### Anonymization by default

When processing `page` event data for analytics component, Edgee implements robust data anonymization techniques. These methods 
are designed to remove or alter personally identifiable information (PII), rendering it impossible to trace the data back to any individual. 
Through this process, data is stripped of identifying details, ensuring it cannot be used to track or identify users.

### The Option for PII Transmission

While our standard practice involves anonymizing all `page` event data, we recognize that certain analytics use cases 
may require the transmission of PII. Edgee supports this capability, allowing developers to include PII in `page` events 
if necessary. However, it's crucial to understand the implications:

- **User Consent is Paramount**: Before sending any PII through Edgee, you must obtain explicit consent from the users whose data is being collected. 
This consent should be informed, meaning users are fully aware of what data is collected and how it will be used.

- **Responsibility of the Developer**: If you choose to send PII with `page` events, the responsibility for managing that data in compliance with 
applicable privacy laws rests with you, the Edgee customer. You must ensure that your data collection practices adhere to GDPR, CCPA, or 
any other relevant data protection regulations.

### The need for consent

With anonymization, we guarantee that default `page` data sent to your analytics components cannot be used to identify and track an individual.
Therefore, **you don't need to ask for consent before sending default `page` event data to Edgee, as no personal data is sent**.

To know more about how we handle privacy, check the dedicated [Privacy](/services/data-collection/privacy) documentation.


## Best Practices for `page` Events

- **Rich Context**: The **Data Layer** allows for the specification of comprehensive context data for each event, enhancing the granularity of analytics data captured. Don't hesitate to provide as much information as possible about the page.
- **Manual JS Compatibility**: Edgee’s manual triggering capabilities ensure that you can collect pageviews without the traditional webpage reloads.
- **Flexible Destination Configuration**: Utilize the components parameter to fine-tune where your data is sent, optimizing for relevance and efficiency.
