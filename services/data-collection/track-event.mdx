The `track` event is a versatile method for recording any actions your users take,
along with descriptive properties about those actions. Each `track` event is identified by a name,
such as "User Subscribe," and can be enriched with properties like "billing plan" to provide context.
These events are crucial for understanding user behavior, measuring the effectiveness of features, and optimizing the user experience.

## Event fields

The `track` event collects the following fields:

Field |  | Type | Description
----- | ----- | ---- | ---
`name` | _required_ | String | The name of the action
`properties` | _optional_ | Object | Free-form dictionary of properties of the action


## How to collect the `track` event?

There are two ways to collect the `track` event:

### 1 - Automatically with the **Edgee Data Layer**

Edgee collects the `track` event automatically each time it receives a **Data Layer** with a `track` event.

Here's a breakdown of how to structure the **Data Layer**:

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_DATA_LAYER__" type="application/json">
{
  "data_collection": {
    "events": [
      {
        "type": "track",
        "data": {
          "name": "color choice",
          "properties": {
            "color": "blue",
            "category": "shoes",
            "label": "Blue Sneakers"
          }
        },
        "components": {
          "edgee/google-analytics": true,
          "edgee/amplitude": false
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
</script>
```

### 2 - Manually 

The `track` event can  be collected manually by calling the `edgee.track()` method via the Edgee SDK. 

Here's a breakdown of how to structure a `track` call:

```javascript
// Syntax: edgee.track(track_obj, components);
edgee.track({
    "name": "color choice",
    "properties": {
        "color": "blue",
        "category": "shoes",
        "label": "Blue Sneakers"
    }
}, {
    "edgee/google-analytics": true,
    "edgee/amplitude": false
});
```

In this example, the `track` event captures a "color choice" event, detailing the item's color, category, and label.

Additionally, you can specify the analytics components where this event data should be sent. If the components parameter is not 
specified, Edgee will look at `data_collection.components` in the **Edgee Data Layer**. If not defined, the event will be sent to all your components.

The `edgee.track()` method expect the following parameters:

field |    | type | description
--- | -- |--- | ---
`track_obj` | _required_ | object\|string | A free-form dictionary object containing properties of the `track` event. This object has to include the `name` field, and can include the `properties` field. If a string is passed, it will be considered as the `name` field.
`components` | _optional_ | object | Specifies which analytics components should receive the event data. This allows for targeted data sending based on your configured components within the Edgee platform.


## Privacy

The `properties` field is designed for capturing any data you wish to collect.

If this field doesn't contain personally identifiable information (PII), collecting the `track` event is 
straightforward and secure without requiring user consent. This is because Edgee anonymizes any personal 
data before it's transmitted to the components.

However, if PII is included in the `properties` field, obtaining user consent prior to data collection is imperative.
Additionally, your data collection methods must comply with GDPR, CCPA, and any other applicable data protection laws.

## Best Practices for `track` Events

- **Descriptive Event Names**: Use clear and descriptive names for your events to ensure that data is easily understandable and actionable.
- **Relevant Properties**: Include properties that offer valuable insights into the event. Avoid overloading events with unnecessary data to maintain clarity.
- **Selective Destination Sending**: Utilize the components parameter to fine-tune where your data is sent, optimizing for relevance and efficiency.
- **Privacy Considerations**: Note that you must ensure that no personally identifiable information (PII) is sent throught the properties field
