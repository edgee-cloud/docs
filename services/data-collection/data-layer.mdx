The **Data Layer** is a powerful feature, providing you with fine-grained control over the data sent to various analytics. This guide will walk 
you through the essentials of crafting a **Data Layer** to enhance your data collection strategy.

## Introduction to Edgee Data Layer

A **Data Layer** is a structured data format used to define and send detailed information about user interactions, 
page characteristics, and more, directly within your HTML page. By including a **Data Layer**, you can instruct Edgee on exactly what data 
to collect, how to process it, and where to send it.

## Inserting a Data Layer in your application

The way you insert a **Data Layer** in your application depends on the [Edgee SDK](/getting-started/sdk) you're using.
For HTML applications you can manually insert the **Data Layer** within a `<script>` tag with `type="application/json"` and a specific ID. 

For React applications, you can use the `EdgeeDataLayer` component from the `react-edgee` package.

<CodeGroup>

```html HTML page
<script id="__EDGEE_DATA_LAYER__" type="application/json">
{
    ...YOUR_DATA_LAYER...
}
</script>
```

```jsx ReactJS page
// import the necessary components
import { EdgeeDataLayer, EdgeeContextObject } from "react-edgee";

// declare your data layer object
const edgeeDataLayer: EdgeeDataLayer = {
  // ...YOUR_DATA_LAYER...
};

// add the EdgeeDataLayer component where you want to render it
return (
  <EdgeeDataLayer data={edgeeDataLayer} />
);
```
</CodeGroup>


<Note>You can place your **Data Layer** anywhere in your page, but it's recommended to include it before the Edgee SDK for optimal performance.</Note>

## Structure of a Data Layer object

Please note that the typical Data Layer object is very small and only includes one or two events.
You can find a few [examples of valid objects](#examples-of-valid-data-layer-objects) at the end of this page.


The following code represents the **full schema** of everything you can define in your Data Layer:

```json

  "data_collection": {
    "events": [
      {
        "type": "page",

### Data Layer fields breakdown

The following fields are defined under `data_collection`:

Field |    | Type | Description
----- | ----- | ---- | ---
`events` | _optional_ | Array | Contains a list of events (see below for the event structure).
`context` | _optional_ | Object | Contains general information that can be used for all events.
`components` | _optional_ | Object | Specifies which components should receive the data. This enables targeted data transmission based on your configuration.


Let's have a look at each field individually.

#### The `events` list 

It contains objects with the following structure.

Field |    | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---- | ---
`type` | _required_ | String | The type of event: `page`, `track`, or `user`.
`data` | _optional_ | Object | The data structure depends on the event type (see detailed pages). This is required for `track` events.
`components` | _optional_ | Object | Specifies which components should receive the data.

Learn more about the [page](/services/data-collection/page-event), [track](/services/data-collection/track-event),
and [user](/services/data-collection/user-event) event types and their structure.


#### The `context` object

It can contain the following fields.

Field |  | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---- | ---
`page` | _optional_ | Object | General info about this page that can be used across events.
`user` | _optional_ | Object | General info about the user that can be used across events.

<Note>
Note: when you define context data about the current `page` or `user`, it's going to be used automatically
for all compatible events, so you don't need to provide the same information multiple times. 
For example, `data_collection.context.user` is used to define the `data` fields for `user` events.
</Note>


#### The `components` object

It can contain the following fields.

Field |  | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---- | ---
`all`| _optional_ | Boolean | Even if you don't define this field, it will be set to `true` by default. But if you set it to `false`, no destination will receive the data.
`<component_name>`| _optional_ | Boolean | If `true`, the specified destination will receive the data. If `false`, the destination will not receive the data.

Use the `components` object to specify which analytics components **should and should not** receive the data. If you do not specify any component, 
all configured components will receive the data by default.

You can find a few examples in the next section.

<Note>
  Remember: the `components` object can be set globally for all data collection or for individual events.
  This gives you full control and the ability to be very granular about what data is sent to which components.
  Please also note that the `components` object defined for an individual event will 
  override the global configuration for that event.
</Note>

## Best Practices

- **Precision and Clarity**: Ensure that each field in the data layer is accurately defined. Clear, descriptive values for page names, categories, and properties enhance data quality.
- **Consent and Privacy**: When including any personally identifiable information (PII) in the `identify` section, ensure you have obtained explicit consent from the user in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your **Data Layer** up to date with any changes in your site structure, user attributes, or analytics components to maintain data accuracy and relevance.
