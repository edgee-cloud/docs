This guide will cover how to create a new edge function component,
compile it to WebAssembly, test it locally, and push it to the Edgee Component Registry.

Before diving into this guide, we highly recommend reviewing these [foundational concepts](./foundations)
and completing the [CLI setup](./developer-guide).

Edge function components are HTTP handlers powered by WebAssembly that allow you to generate custom responses such as HTML, JSON, etc.
Each edge function component is configured with a specific path (or prefix)
and runs in a sandboxed environment with limited access to OS functionalities.

## How to create a new edge function component

### Component bootstrapping

Run `edgee components new` to create a new edge function component and choose your preferred programming language.
This creates a local folder containing sample code and tools to help you get started quickly.

<CodeGroup>

```shell Guided UX
$ edgee components new
? Enter the component name: my-edge-function
? Select a programming language:
  C
  CSharp
  Go
  JavaScript
  Python
> Rust
  TypeScript
? Select component type:
  Data Collection
> Edge Function
 INFO Downloading sample code for Rust edge-function...
 INFO Extracting code...
 INFO Downloading WIT files...
 INFO New project my-edge-function is ready! Check README for dependencies.
```

```shell Inline options
$ edgee components new --name my-edge-function --language rust --category edge-function
 INFO Downloading sample code for Rust edge-function...
 INFO Extracting code...
 INFO Downloading WIT files...
 INFO New project my-edge-function is ready! Check README for dependencies.
```

</CodeGroup>

Navigate to the new folder to begin customizing your component and implementing its business logic.

### Component manifest file

Your component's manifest file is named `edgee-component.toml`. It contains all the information required to
build, test, and push your component via the Edgee CLI.

Components created via `edgee components new` already include a default manifest you can easily customize.
In case you prefer managing the local folder and starting from a blank implementation, feel free to use
`edgee components init` to initialize an empty manifest in the current folder.

A typical manifest file for an edge function component looks like this:

```toml
manifest-version = 1

[component]
name = "Your Edge Function Name"
slug = "your-edge-function-name"
version = "0.0.1"
language = "Rust"
category = "edge-function"
subcategory = "wasm-function"
description = "Your edge function description"
documentation = "https://example.com/link-to-your-documentation"
repository = "https://github.com/your-account/your-repository"
icon-path = "path-to-local-file.png"
wit-version = "1.0.0"

[component.build]
command = "your-build-command"
output-path = "./edge_function.wasm"

[component.settings.example-config]
title = "Configuration Value"
type = "string"
required = true
description = "A configuration value needed for this edge function"

[component.settings.example-toggle]
title = "Feature Toggle"
type = "bool"
required = false
description = "Enable or disable a specific feature"

[component.settings.example-secret]
title = "API Secret"
type = "string"
required = true
secret = true
description = "A secret API key that will be encrypted"
```

Let's go through each section and field:

- `manifest-version`: it indicates the expected structure of your manifest file, the only available value for now is `1`.
- `[component]`: here you define what your component is all about, including its public name and latest version
  - `name`: the name of this component, will be used for URLs and shown on public pages.
  - `slug`: the slug of this component, will be used for URLs and shown on public pages.
  Note: the slug is used as an identifier by the CLI (for a given organization).
  In other words, if you change a component's slug, you will create a brand new component.
  A slug should change only when absolutely necessary.
  - `version`: the latest version of this component, will be used when pushing to update or create versions.
  - `language`: the programming language used this component, will be used to automate some language-specific
  build or compilation details. It's automatically configured if you start with a starter template.
  - `category`: for edge function components, the value should be `edge-function`.
  - `subcategory`: the available value is `wasm-function`.
  - `description`: the description of this component, will be shown on public pages.
  - `documentation`: the documentation URL for this component (could also point to a public repository).
  - `repository`: the repository URL for this component (e.g. on GitHub).
  - `icon-path`: the image used on public pages to represent this component.
  - `wit-version`: the WIT interface implemented by this component. When a new WIT version is available,
  update this field to the latest version and the Edgee CLI will take care of updating all WIT dependencies for you.

- `[component.build]`: here you define how the component is built and where the resulting Wasm file is located.
  - `command`: the command to compile this component into Wasm, depends on your programming language of choice.
  - `output-path`: the local file path where your compiled Wasm binary is stored, will be used for local testing and pushing
  (make sure this is aligned with the build command defined above).

- `[component.settings.X]`: here you define as many settings as needed (see [Reusability and settings](#reusability-and-settings) below)
  - `title`: text that will be shown in the web console to identify this setting.
  - `type`: valid values are `string`, `number`, or `bool`.
  - `required`: (optional) a bool value to indicate whether this setting is required or not, false by default.
  - `description`: (optional) text that will be shown in the web console to describe this setting.
  - `options`: (optional) the allowed values for this setting.
  - `secret`: (optional) a bool value to indicate whether this setting value should be encrypted, false by default.

If you started via `edgee components new`, most fields come with good defaults and you only need to customize
your component's name, description, documentation URL, repository URL, and settings.

### Implementing your component

An edge function component must implement the WASI HTTP interface, specifically:

```text
world edge-function {
  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0;
  import wasi:http/outgoing-handler@0.2.0;
}
```

This means your edge function acts as an HTTP handler that can:
- **Export** `wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0` to handle incoming HTTP requests
- **Import** `wasi:http/outgoing-handler@0.2.0` to make outgoing HTTP requests (if needed)

In other words, your edge function receives an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response.

<CodeGroup>

```rust Rust
impl Guest for Component {
    fn handle(req: IncomingRequest, resp: ResponseOutparam) {
        // your business logic here
    }
}
```

```go Go
func Handle(request incominghandler.IncomingRequest, responseOut incominghandler.ResponseOutparam) {
  // your business logic here
}
```

```c C
void exports_wasi_http_incoming_handler_handle(exports_wasi_http_incoming_handler_own_incoming_request_t request, exports_wasi_http_incoming_handler_own_response_outparam_t response_out) {
  // your business logic here
}
```

```csharp C#
public class IncomingHandlerImpl: IIncomingHandler {
    public static void Handle(ITypes.IncomingRequest request, ITypes.ResponseOutparam responseOut) {
        // your business logic here
    }
}
```

```javascript JavaScript
function handle(req, resp) {
  // your business logic here
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
function handle(req: IncomingRequest, resp: ResponseOutparam) {
  // your business logic here
}
```

```python Python
from helpers import get_body, get_headers, get_settings
class IncomingHandler(exports.IncomingHandler):
    def handle(self, request: IncomingRequest, response_out: ResponseOutparam):
        # your business logic here
```

</CodeGroup>

The handler function automatically received all settings configured in your manifest via the
`x-edgee-component-settings` HTTP header, encoded as JSON.
Don't worry, this is already implemented in the sample code provided when using `edgee components new`.

### How to trigger edge functions

Edge functions are triggered by path matching using two special settings
that can be configured when adding your component to an Edgee project:
- `edgee_path`: exact path match such as `/api/auth`.
- `edgee_path_prefix`: path prefix match such as `/api/` (both `/api/users` and `/api/posts` will match).

When an incoming HTTP request matches your configured path, the Edgee platform will:
1. Include your component settings as HTTP header
2. Invoke your edge function with the corresponding HTTP request
3. Return your function's response directly to the client

Based on the programming language you chose, you'll find the corresponding WASI HTTP bindings
and unit tests to help you with the implementation.

<Note>
  **Important Limitations**: Edge functions run in a strictly sandboxed environment with
  limited access to OS capabilities such as file system or advanced networking.
  For example:
  - You have no persistent storage (databases, files, or stateful data)
  - You're limited to the WASI-based HTTP interface to communicate with external services or APIs (without relying on complex SDKs or HTTP libraries)
</Note>

### Reusability and settings

To make your Edgee edge function component reusable for other developers and organizations via the Edgee Component Registry,
you can define a set of input `settings`, containing all the configuration parameters,
API credentials, or dynamic information needed for your edge function to operate correctly.

For example, a simple API edge function might expect `api_key` and `allowed_origins`,
while a content serving edge function might expect `content_type` and `template_id`.

You can configure the expected settings for your component by adding the following for each setting in your manifest file:

```toml
[component.settings.example-name]
title = "Your Pretty Name"
type = "string|number|bool"
required = true|false
description = "Your setting's description"
options ["value1", "value2", "value3"]
secret = true|false
```

<Note>
  Note: only `title` and `type` are mandatory to define a setting.
  In this case, `example-name` is the key your business logic will use to get its value from the settings.
</Note>

<Note>
  Note: even if defined as `number` or `bool`, all settings are treated as strings when your component receives them.
  For now, you'll need to parse them into the correct type. In the future, our WIT definitions will handle types automatically as well.
</Note>


### Accessing settings in your function

Your edge function receives all configured settings as JSON in the `x-edgee-component-settings` HTTP header.

The sample code provided when using `edgee components new` already provides some utility code to parse
headers, settings, and body from the incoming HTTP request.

For example:

<CodeGroup>

```rust Rust
impl Guest for Component {
    fn handle(req: IncomingRequest, resp: ResponseOutparam) {
        let settings = match Settings::from_req(&req) {
            Ok(settings) => settings,
            Err(_) => {
                // return an error response with helpers::build_response
            }
        };
        println!("Received API key: {:?}", settings.api_key);

        let body = match helpers::parse_body(req) {
            Ok(body) => body,
            Err(e) => {
                // return an error response with helpers::build_response
            }
        };
        println!("Received body: {:?}", body);
    }
}
```

```go Go
func Handle(request incominghandler.IncomingRequest, responseOut incominghandler.ResponseOutparam) {
  headers = get_headers(request)
  settings := get_settings(request)
  incoming_body := get_body(request)
}
```

```c C
void exports_wasi_http_incoming_handler_handle(exports_wasi_http_incoming_handler_own_incoming_request_t request, exports_wasi_http_incoming_handler_own_response_outparam_t response_out) {
  // parse incoming
  wasi_http_types_borrow_incoming_request_t borrowed_request = wasi_http_types_borrow_incoming_request(request);
  wasi_http_types_own_headers_t hdrs = wasi_http_types_method_incoming_request_headers(borrowed_request);
  wasi_http_types_borrow_fields_t borrowed_headers = wasi_http_types_borrow_fields(hdrs);
  struct component_settings settings = parse_settings(&borrowed_headers);

  edge_function_string_t incoming_body;
  parse_body(borrowed_request, &incoming_body);
}
```

```csharp C#
public class IncomingHandlerImpl: IIncomingHandler {
    public static void Handle(ITypes.IncomingRequest request, ITypes.ResponseOutparam responseOut) {
        var incoming_headers = RequestUtility.parseHeaders(request);
        var settings = RequestUtility.parseSetting(incoming_headers);
        var incoming_body = RequestUtility.parseBody(request);
    }
}
```

```javascript JavaScript
function handle(req, resp) {
  const settings = Settings.fromHeaders(req.headers());
  console.log(`Received API key: ${settings.api_key}`);
  const body = parseBody(req);
  console.log(`Received body: ${body}`);
}
```

```typescript TypeScript
function handle(req: IncomingRequest, resp: ResponseOutparam) {
  const settings = Settings.fromHeaders(req.headers());
  console.log(`Received API key: ${settings.api_key}`);
  const body = parseBody(req);
  console.log(`Received body: ${body}`);
}
```

```python Python
from helpers import get_body, get_headers, get_settings
class IncomingHandler(exports.IncomingHandler):
    def handle(self, request: IncomingRequest, response_out: ResponseOutparam):
        incoming_headers = get_headers(request)
        settings = get_settings(incoming_headers)
        body = get_body(request)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Build and test locally

When the implementation is ready, compile your component into Wasm:

```shell
$ edgee components build
```

You can customize the behavior of the build command in the manifest file by changing the target file name
and the default build script. If you've created a new component with `edgee components new` the default build script
should be a great starting point. By default, the output of this command will be a new Wasm file in the current folder.

<WarningCliBuildCommand />

Before pushing your component to the Edgee Component Registry, it's highly recommended to validate and test the Wasm file locally:

<CodeGroup>

```shell Defaults
# validate local Wasm file (this automatically runs on push)
$ edgee components check

# start local HTTP server for testing
$ edgee components test --settings "setting1=value1,setting2=value2"
Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

```shell Settings file
# use local toml file to pass settings
$ edgee components test --settings-file settings.toml
Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

```shell Custom port
# customize the port for the local HTTP server
$ edgee components test [...] --port 3000
Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

```shell Watch mode
# automatically rebuild the component on source code changes
$ edgee components test [...] --watch
Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8000
...
Detected source change, rebuilding component...
```

</CodeGroup>

The test command starts a local HTTP server running your edge function.
You can use curl, your browser, or another HTTP client to interact with the local server and test your component's behavior.

<Note>
  Note: the test command is using your Wasm file, not your source code directly.
  You can use the `--watch` flag to automatically rebuild your component on source code changes.
</Note>

### Testing with local HTTP requests

For example, a test HTTP request might look like:

```http
GET /api/users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; EdgeeTest/1.0)
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Content-Type: application/json
X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.1.100
```

Your edge function will receive this as a WASI HTTP request object and can:
- Inspect request headers and body
- Extract encoded data from the request
- Make HTTP requests to external services to send or fetch data
- Generate and return a custom HTTP response such as HTML or JSON

<Note>
  Note: you can craft custom test requests that better suit your component's needs
  by creating test scenarios in your component's test suite.
</Note>

### Verify HTTP responses

By default, the test command runs your local Wasm file and shows you:
1. The incoming HTTP request your edge function received
2. Any outgoing HTTP requests your edge function made
3. The final HTTP response your edge function returned

Once the test server is running, you can test your edge function with curl:

```shell
# Example curl command to test your edge function
$ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/your-path \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}'
```

The test server will pass your configured settings to the edge function via the `x-edgee-component-settings` header.

<Note>
  Note: if your component interacts with external services, we recommend using test or staging environments
  whenever possible to avoid affecting production systems or external APIs during testing.
</Note>

## Push to the registry

When your component is ready for deployment, it's time to push it to the registry.

Make sure you went through these steps so far:
1. Installed and configured the Edgee CLI
2. Implemented the WASI HTTP interface
3. Updated your manifest file with the correct build command and settings
4. Validated the Wasm file with local tests
5. Decided on the component's visibility (public or private)

Then run the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```shell Guided experience
$ edgee components push
 INFO Component org/name does not exists yet!
> Confirm new component creation? Y/n
? Would you like to make this component public or private?
> private
  public
> Describe the new version changelog (optional) [(e) to open nano, (enter) to submit]
> Ready to push org/name@version. Confirm? Y/n
 INFO Uploading Wasm file...
 INFO Creating new version...
 INFO org/name@version pushed successfully!
 INFO URL: https://www.edgee.cloud/~/registry/{organization}/{component}
```

```shell Programmatic experience
$ edgee components push --public --changelog "Lorem ipsum"
 INFO Component org/name does not exists yet!
> Confirm new component creation? Y/n
> Ready to push org/name@version. Confirm? Y/n
 INFO Uploading Wasm file...
 INFO Creating new version...
 INFO org/name@version pushed successfully!
 INFO URL: https://www.edgee.cloud/~/registry/{organization}/{component}
```

</CodeGroup>

Your new component will be pushed to the Edgee Component Registry under your Organization.
In case your Edgee user is part of multiple Organizations, you can provide the organization identifier
via `edgee components push ORG_ID`.

Congratulations! Your edge function component is now available on the Edgee Component Registry at `https://www.edgee.cloud/{organization}/{component}`.
In case you pushed a private component, its page is only visible to you.

You can also view and edit it at `https://www.edgee.cloud/~/registry/{organization}`.

### Publish/unpublish components

A public component is visible to anyone in the registry, while private components are only available to a specific organization.

During the initial push, you decide between private or public. Every subsequent push command will keep the same
visibility. If you need to publish a private component or unpublish a public component after the initial push, you'll need
to declare the visibility change explicitly:

<CodeGroup>

```shell Publish a private component
$ edgee components push --public
```

```shell Unpublish a public component
$ edgee components push --private
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Note: unpublishing a public component is only possible as long as the component isn't used by any project.
  You can still push the same component as private for a specific organization. This might be useful for special
  use cases where a component needs ad-hoc customizations.
</Note>

### Archive/delete components

After pushing, visit `https://www.edgee.cloud/~/registry/{organization}` and select your component to edit it.
Here you can **archive** or **delete** it with the corresponding buttons.

Please note that:

- **Archived components** become invisible on public pages, but can be unarchived.
Existing projects using an archived component still work fine.
- **Deleted components** simply stop existing and this action is irreversible.
If there is at least one Edgee project using a component, you cannot delete it.

<Note>
  Note: even though the web console allows you to edit most fields and create new versions, we recommend using the Edgee CLI
  to push updates and new versions. This way, your manifest file remains the source of truth.
</Note>

## Use the edge function component

Once your edge function component is available via the Edgee Component Registry, you can add it to a project and it will start processing HTTP requests.

First of all, you'll need to [create a project](/getting-started/project-settings) and configure it for your website.
Unlike data collection components, edge functions don't require the Edgee SDK - they work directly with HTTP traffic.

Visit the **Components** section of your project and click **Add a component**. Here you can filter by category,
organization, and visibility. Make sure to select **Private** in the bottom-left if you pushed a private component.
Select **edge-function** in the category filter to see only edge function components.

Select your edge function component and configure it. A few things to keep in mind:

1. You can select a specific version of your component, by default the latest version is selected.
2. Enable **Auto update** if you want to automatically use the latest version of your component for this project.
3. Configure the path matching by setting either:
   - `edgee_path`: For exact path matches (e.g., `/api/auth`)
   - `edgee_path_prefix`: For path prefix matches (e.g., `/api/` matches all paths starting with `/api/`)

Once the project is set up and your edge function component is active, it will start processing HTTP requests that match your configured path.

Your edge function can:
- Generate custom API responses
- Serve static content or dynamic responses
- Implement simple authentication endpoints
- Create redirect responses
- Make HTTP requests to external services to send or fetch data
- Return responses with custom headers and status codes

<Note>
  **Performance Considerations**: Edge functions run on every matching request in a WebAssembly sandbox.
  Keep implementations lightweight and efficient since they cannot access persistent storage or maintain state.
</Note>
