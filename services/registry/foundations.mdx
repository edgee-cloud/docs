The following concepts will get you up and running with Edgee, before you start coding.

#### Reverse proxy
Edgee acts as a [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) in front of a website, intercepting HTTP requests and running business
logic on top of edge networks and CDNs such as Fastly and Cloudflare.

The Edgee proxy interacts with WebAssembly components to implement features such as data collection for analytics, warehousing, and conversions.

#### WebAssembly and language support
[WebAssembly (Wasm)](https://webassembly.org/) allows developers to implement a component in programming languages such as Rust or JavaScript
and compile it to a binary format. Each component runs in a sandboxed environment with no access to network or filesystem
and implements a specific interface used by the Edgee proxy to invoke a component's business logic.

You use WebAssembly as compile target with [many different languages](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/language-support.html)
and the resulting binary file is language-agnostic and cross-platform. Today, Edgee supports and provides tooling for
Rust, Go, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, and C#. The Edgee CLI makes local development consistent across languages,
but it's worth noting that compiled languages such as Rust, Go, and C result in pretty small and efficient Wasm files (within hundreds of KBs),
while interpreted languages such as Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript result in much heavier Wasm files (20MB+).

#### Component types and WIT
Today, Edgee supports only one component type: Data Collection. That includes components
for web analytics such as
[Google Analytics](/components/data-collection/google-analytics) or [Amplitude](/components/data-collection/amplitude),
for attribution/conversion such as
[Meta Conversions API](/components/data-collection/meta-capi) or [LinkedIn Conversions API](/components/data-collection/linkedin-capi),
and for data streaming and warehousing destinations such as
[Amazon S3](/components/data-collection/amazon-data-firehose),
[Amazon Kinesis](/components/data-collection/amazon-kinesis),
or [Amazon Data Firehose](/components/data-collection/amazon-data-firehose).

We're quickly expanding to new component types such as Consent Mapping to integrate with CMPs (Consent Management Platforms)
and A/B Testing to integrate with A/B testing frameworks and services at the edge.

In Wasm, interfaces are defined with [WIT (Wasm Interface Type)](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html),
a definition language to define types and worlds. You can find [Edgee's WIT files on GitHub](https://github.com/edgee-cloud/edgee-wit).
The convention is to store them under a `wit/` folder and define your WIT dependencies in a `wit/deps.toml` file.
When a new WIT version is available, you can use [wit-deps](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-deps) to keep all the WIT dependencies up-to-date.
Depending on the programming language, you might need to re-generate the WIT bindings as well.

<Note>
    Note: since `v0.9.0`, the Edgee CLI takes care of managing and updating WIT dependencies automatically for you, under
    a hidden `.edgee/wit` folder. You shouldn't need to worry about WIT dependencies at all.

    When a new WIT release is available, you only need to update the `wit-version` in your component's manifest.
</Note>

#### Edgee CLI and APIs
The [Edgee CLI](https://github.com/edgee-cloud/edgee) lets you create and build Wasm components locally with commands such as
`edgee components new` and `edgee components build`.
When the component is ready, it lets you push it to the Edgee Component Registry as a public or private component
under your organization's account via `edgee components push`. Under the hood, the CLI interacts with the
[Edgee API](/api-reference/introduction) and its goal is to simplify the local development experience across all supported languages.
