<Warning>
    BETA: this page refers to a beta version of the Edgee Component Registry.
    Breaking changes might happen in the next few weeks, please consider this unstable and share your feedback in the
    appropriate channels if you find a bug or security vulnerability.
</Warning>


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is an edge component??">
    An edge component is a simple piece of business logic that runs at the edge, just before an HTML page is served to a visitor's browser.
    Depending on the page content, a component may invoke 3rd-party APIs, edit the HTML response, or manipulate HTTP headers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What tooling is available for local development and testing?">
    You can use the Edgee CLI to build and publish new components from your laptop.
    The Edgee CLI also acts as the reverse proxy you can use to serve and test components locally before pushing to the registry.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What programming languages can I use to develop a new component?">
    You can use all programming languages that compile to Wasm, with WASI and component support,
    such as C, C#, Go, JavaScript, Python, and Rust.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I keep a component private? And how do I make it public?">
    When pushing a component for the first time, the Edgee CLI will ask you to set it as public or private.
    Once pushed, you can easily change its visibility using the web console.
    Please keep in mind that a public component can be unpublished or deleted only if there are no projects using it,
    so make sure you're 100% comfortable with your component being publicly visible when pushing it as public.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I push different versions of my component to the registry?">
    Every time you push via the CLI, a new version is created. Remember to update the latest version in your manifest file before pushing.

    Also keep in mind that projects always use your latest versions (for now). Eventually it will be possible to bind projects to a
    specific version and handle version upgrades manually or automatically.

    During the beta, make sure that your latest version doesn't include breaking changes.
    For example, you can add a new optional setting without issues, while removing or adding a new required setting
    would break the existing projects' configuration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does my public component need to be open source?">
    All Edgee-native components are public and open source and we'd love to encourage all component developers to keep their
    projects open source as well. This allows you to build trust and encourages other developers to get involved with bugfixing
    and other maintenance tasks. That said, we understand there might be special cases where organizations are more comfortable with
    publishing closed-source components and the Edgee platforms supports that too.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need an Edgee account to create and publish components?">
    Yes, components are bound to your Edgee account or your organization's Edgee account.
    On the other hand, Edgee Open Source Edition users can use the Edgee Component Registry to pull and add public components
    to their proxy configuration as well.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the Edgee Component Registry for free?">
    Yes, the Edgee Component Registry is free of charge.
    With Edgee's managed service, you only get charged for the events and requests generated by your projects.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I use components published by other developers in my Edgee project?">
    You can easily add a component to your projects from a public component's page, simply click “Add to my project”.
    Alternatively, you can visit your project's dashboard and visit the “Registry” tab to list all public and private components available to you.
    Last but not least, you could use the [Edgee API](/api-reference/introduction) to automate every step, from project creation to component integration.
