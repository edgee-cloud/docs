<EdgeeSdk />

<Warning>
    BETA: this page refers to a beta version of the Edgee Component Registry.
    Breaking changes might happen in the next few weeks, please consider this unstable and share your feedback in the
    appropriate channels if you find a bug or security vulnerability.
</Warning>

This guide will cover how to create and test a new component locally,
compile it to WebAssembly, and push it to the Edgee Component Registry.

Before diving into this guide, we highly recommend reviewing these [foundational concepts](./foundations).

## How to create a new Edgee component

### Step 1: Install and configure

First, install the Edgee CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash install script
# will download binary executable for your system
$ curl https://install.edgee.cloud | sh
$ ./edgee --version
```

```bash homebrew
# will download and build locally
$ brew tap edgee-cloud/edgee
$ brew install edgee
$ edgee --version

# when you need to update to the latest release:
$ brew update
$ brew install edgee
```

```bash build from source (Rust)
$ git clone https://github.com/edgee-cloud/edgee.git
$ cd edgee
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/edgee --version
```


</CodeGroup>

Second, log in using the token from your Edgee account (you can [create one here](https://www.edgee.cloud/~/me/settings/tokens)):

```bash 
$ edgee login
Enter Edgee API token (press Ctrl+R to toggle input display): ****
```

Verify that the API is working correctly using this token:

```bash 
$ edgee whoami
Logged in as:
  ID:    XYZ-XYZ-DYZ
  Name:  Your name
  Email: your@email.com
```

#### How to get CLI help

If you need guidance on a given command or sub-command, check out the `help` command:

```bash 
$ edgee help
Usage: edgee <COMMAND>
Commands:
  login       Log in to the Edgee Console
  whoami      Print currently login informations
  components  Components management commands  [aliases: component]
  serve       Run the Edgee server [aliases: server]
```

You can also use it to explore available sub-commands:

```bash
$ edgee help components
Usage: edgee components <COMMAND>
Commands:
  build  Compile the component in the current directory into Wasm
  check  Check if the local Wasm file file is valid
  init   Initialize a new manifest file in the current directory
  list   List components you previously pulled (coming soon)
  new    Create component in a new directory with sample code
  pull   Pull a component from the Edgee Component Registry (coming soon)
  push   Push a component to the Edgee Component Registry
  test   Run the component in the current folder with sample events
```

Or command-specific options:

```bash
$ edgee help components test
Usage: edgee components test [OPTIONS]
Options:
  --settings <SETTINGS>      Comma-separated key=value pairs for settings
  --event-type <EVENT_TYPE>  The event type you want to test [possible values: page, track, user]
  --display-input            Whether to log the full input event or not (false by default)
```

Alternatively, `--help` and `-h` also work in all cases.

### Step 2: Create a new component

Next, run `edgee components new` to create a new component and choose your preferred programming language.
This creates a local folder containing sample code and tools to help you get started quickly.

```bash 
$ edgee components new
? Enter the name of the component: my-component
? Select the language of the component:
  C
  CSharp
  Go
  JavaScript
  Python
> Rust
  TypeScript
Downloading sample code for Rust...
Extracting code...
New project my-component setup, check README to install the correct dependencies
```

Navigate to the new folder to begin customizing your component and implementing its business logic.

#### Component manifest file

Your component's manifest file is named `edgee-component.toml`. It contains all the information required to
build, test, and push your component via the Edgee CLI.

Components created via `edgee components new` already include a default manifest you can easily customize.
In case you prefer managing the local folder and starting from a blank implementation, feel free to use
`edgee components init` to initialize an empty manifest in the current folder.

A typical manifest file looks like this:

```toml
manifest-version = 1

[component]
name = "your-component-name"
version = "0.0.1"
category = "data-collection"
subcategory = "analytics"
description = "Your component description"
documentation = "https://example.com/link-to-your-documentation"
repository = "https://github.com/your-account/your-repository"
wit-world-version = "0.4.0"

[component.build]
command = "your-build-command"
output-path = "./dc_component.wasm"

[component.settings.example-api-key]
title = "Your API Key"
type = "string"
required = true
description = "The API key you need for this component to work"

[component.settings.example-choice]
title = "Your choice setting"
type = "string"
required = true
options = ["value1", "value2", "value3"]
```

Let's go through each section and field:

- `manifest-version`: it indicates the expected structure of your manifest file, the only available value for now is `1`.
- `[component]`: here you define what your component is all about, including its public name and latest version
  - `name`: the name of this component, will be used for URLs and shown on public pages.
  - `version`: the latest version of this component, will be used when pushing to update or create versions.
  - `category`: the only available value for now is `data-collection`.
  - `subcategory`: the available values for now are `analytics`, `warehouse`, and `attribution`.
  - `description`: the description of this component, will be shown on public pages.
  - `documentation`: the documentation URL for this component (could also point to a public repository).
  - `repository`: the repository URL for this component (e.g. on GitHub).
  - `wit-world-version`: the WIT version of the interface implemented by this component, the only available value for now is `0.4.0` (will become `1.0.0` at launch).

- `[component.build]`: here you define how the component is built and where the resulting Wasm file is located.
  - `command`: the command to compile this component into Wasm, depends on your programming language of choice.
  - `output-path`: the local file path where your compiled Wasm binary is stored, will be used for local testing and pushing
  (make sure this is aligned with the build command defined above).

- `[component.settings.X]`: here you define as many settings as needed (see [Reusability and settings](#reusability-and-settings) below)
  - `title`: text that will be shown in the web console to identify this setting.
  - `type`: valid values are `string`, `number`, or `bool`.
  - `required`: (optional) a bool value to indicate whether this setting is required or not, false by default.
  - `description`: (optional) text that will be shown in the web console to describe this setting.
  - `options`: (optional) the allowed values for this setting.

If you started via `edgee components new`, most fields come with good defaults and you only need to customize
your component's name, description, documentation URL, repository URL, and settings.

#### Implementing your component

A data collection component must implement the following WIT interface:

```text
page: func(e: event, settings: dict) -> result<edgee-request, string>;
track: func(e: event, settings: dict) -> result<edgee-request, string>;
user: func(e: event, settings: dict) -> result<edgee-request, string>;
```

The corresponding method is invoked when a `page`, `track` or `user` event is sent for data collection
by the Edgee proxy. These methods receive the incoming event object and a set of settings.
They're expected to return an `edgee-request` object, which looks like this:

```text
record edgee-request {
    method: http-method,
    url: string,
    headers: dict,
    forward-client-headers: bool,
    body: string,
}
```
If you're curious to dive deeper into the WIT definitions, [check out the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/edgee-cloud/edgee-wit).

Based on the programming language, you'll find the corresponding types and unit tests to help you with the implementation.
In case you're having trouble with implementing your component, check out other existing components such as
[Google Analytics](https://github.com/edgee-cloud/ga-component),
[Segment](https://github.com/edgee-cloud/segment-component),
[Amplitude](https://github.com/edgee-cloud/amplitude-component),
[Meta CAPI](https://github.com/edgee-cloud/meta-capi-component),
[LinkedIn CAPI](https://github.com/edgee-cloud/linkedin-capi-component),
or [Amazon S3](https://github.com/edgee-cloud/s3-component).

<Note>
  Note: Edgee components don't perform HTTP calls directly, as they run in a sandboxed environment with no access
  to network or file system. The intended purpose of a component is to instruct the proxy on which HTTP request to perform
  to fullfil its data collection duties.

  For example, the Google Analytics component returns an `edgee-request` object that points to the official
`https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect` endpoint, with the correct querystring parameters.
Similarly, the Amazon S3 component points to `https://{bucket}.s3.amazonaws.com` with the correct sigv4 authentication headers.
</Note>

#### Reusability and settings

To make your Edgee component reusable for other developers and organizations via the Edgee Component Registry,
you can define a set of input `settings`, containing all the API credentials or dynamic
information you need to craft the correct `edgee-request` object. For example, the Google Analytics component only expects a
`ga_measurement_id` setting, while the Segment component expects `segment_project_id` and `segment_write_key`.

You can configure the expected settings for your component by adding the following for each setting in your manifest file:

```toml
[component.settings.example-name]
title = "Your Pretty Name"
type = "string|number|bool"
required = true|false
description = "Your setting's description"
options ["value1", "value2", "value3"]
```

<Note>
  Note: only `title` and `type` are mandatory to define a setting. In this example `example-name` is the key your business logic
  will use to get its value from the `settings` dict.
</Note>

### Step 3: Build and test locally

When the implementation is ready, build your component locally:

```bash
$ edgee components build
```



You can customize the behavior of the build command in the manifest file by changing the target file name
and the default build script. If you've created a new component with `edgee component new` the default build script
should be a great starting point. By default, the output of this command will be a new Wasm file in the current folder.

Before pushing your component to the Edgee Component Registry, it's highly recommended to validate and test the Wasm file locally:

```bash
# validate local Wasm file
$ edgee components check

# run the Wasm file with test events
$ edgee components test \
    --event-type page \
    --settings "setting1=value1,setting2=value2"
```

Use the test command to run your local Wasm file with a sample event and provided settings.
If no `--event-type` is provided, it will run the Wasm file with all event types (page, track, and user).
This helps ensure your component behaves as expected from the proxy's perspective, in addition to your unit tests.

#### Test events

Test events represent the typical structure of an Edgee event.

<Warning>
  BETA: for now test events are static objects, eventually you'll be able to provide a custom JSON object that
  better suits your component's needs.
</Warning>

For example, the sample `page` event looks like the following:

```json

{
    "uuid": "37009b9b-a572-4615-87c1-09e257331ecb",
    "timestamp": "2025-02-03T15:46:39.283317613Z",
    "type": "page",
    "data": {
        "keywords": [
            "demo",
            "tag manager"
        ],
        "title": "Page with Edgee components",
        "url": "https://demo.edgee.app/analytics-with-edgee.html",
        "path": "/analytics-with-edgee.html",
        "referrer": "https://demo.edgee.dev/analytics-with-js.html"
    },
    "context": {
        "page": {
            "keywords": [
                "demo",
                "tag manager"
            ],
            "title": "Page with Edgee components",
            "url": "https://demo.edgee.app/analytics-with-edgee.html",
            "path": "/analytics-with-edgee.html",
            "referrer": "https://demo.edgee.dev/analytics-with-js.html"
        },
        "user": {
            "edgee_id": "6bb171d5-2284-41ee-9889-91af03b71dc5"
        },
        "client": {
            "ip": "127.0.0.1",
            "locale": "en-us",
            "accept_language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
            "timezone": "Europe/Paris",
            "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64)AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/132.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
            "user_agent_version_list": "Not A(Brand;8|Chromium;132",
            "user_agent_mobile": "0",
            "os_name": "Linux",
            "user_agent_architecture": "x86",
            "user_agent_bitness": "64",
            "user_agent_full_version_list": "Not A(Brand;8.0.0.0|Chromium;132.0.6834.159",
            "user_agent_model": "",
            "os_version": "6.12.11",
            "screen_width": 1920,
            "screen_height": 1280,
            "screen_density": 1.5
        },
        "session": {
            "session_id": "1738597536",
            "session_count": 1,
            "session_start": false,
            "first_seen": "2025-02-03T15:45:36.569004889Z",
            "last_seen": "2025-02-03T15:46:39.278740029Z"
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that you don't need to manually parse the input event in your business logic.
Your handlers will receive it in the form of a native object in your language of choice, thanks to Wasm/WIT's code generation.

### Step 3: Push the component 

When you're ready to publish your component, it's time to push it to the registry.

Make sure you went through these steps so far:
1. Installed and configured the Edgee CLI
2. Implemented the Edgee WIT interface
4. Updated your manifest file with the correct build command and settings
3. Validated the Wasm file with local tests
4. Decided on the component's visibility (public or private)

Then run the following command:

```bash
$ edgee components push
? Component org/name does not exists, do you want to create it? Y/n
? Would you like to make this component public or private?
> private
  public
Component org/name created successfully!
Check it out here: https://www.edgee.cloud/~/registry/{organization}/{component}
```

Your new component will be pushed to the Edgee Component Registry under your Organization.
In case your Edgee user is part of multiple Organizations, you can provide it explicitly via `edgee components push ORG_NAME`.

Congratulations! Your (public) component is now available on the Edgee Component Registry at `https://www.edgee.cloud/{organization}/{component}`.
In case you pushed a private component, there won't be a public page.

You can also view and edit it at `https://www.edgee.cloud/~/registry/{organization}`.


<Warning>
  BETA: during the first week(s) of beta testing you won't be able to add components to a project and test it in production.
  We kindly ask you to be patient and focus on the local development experience while we work hard to make the registry
  fully compatible with our managed service.

  In the meantime, you can run the open source proxy locally and configure it to use a local Wasm file via `edgee serve`.
  [Learn more about the Edgee Proxy](https://github.com/edgee-cloud/edgee/blob/main/README-proxy.md).
</Warning>

#### How to add a custom icon

Make your component stand out in the registry with a clear icon that represents your company or product.

<Frame caption="Component and Organization icons help your components stand out in the registry!">
  <img
    src="/images/registry-icons.png"
    alt="Edgee Component Registry icons"
    align={"center"}
  />
</Frame>

After pushing, visit `https://www.edgee.cloud/~/registry/{organization}` and select your component to edit it.
Here you can update your component's icon and make sure it displays correctly on the public pages.

<Warning>
  BETA: you will be able to handle icon uploads directly with `edgee components push` soon.
</Warning>


#### How to archive/delete components

After pushing, visit `https://www.edgee.cloud/~/registry/{organization}` and select your component to edit it.
Here you can **archive** or **delete** it with the corresponding buttons.

Please note that:

- **Archived components** become invisible on public pages, but can be unarchived.
Existing projects using an archived component still work fine.
- **Deleted components** simply stop existing and this action is irreversible.
If there is at least one Edgee project using a component, you cannot delete it.

<Note>
  Note: even though the web console allows you to edit most fields and creeate new versions, we highly recommend using the Edgee CLI
  to push updates and new versions. That way, your manifest file remains the source of truth.
</Note>
