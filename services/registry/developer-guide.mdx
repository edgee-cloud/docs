This guide provides an overview of creating components for the Edgee Component Registry.
Edgee supports two types of components: **data collection** and **edge function** components.

Before diving into development, we highly recommend reviewing these [foundational concepts](./foundations).

## Component Types

### Data Collection Components
Data collection components process analytics events (page views, user interactions, etc.) and transform them into HTTP requests to external services like Google Analytics, Segment, or custom APIs.

### Edge Function Components
Edge function components are WebAssembly functions that handle HTTP requests at specific paths, enabling custom API endpoints, authentication logic, and request processing at the edge.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Complete the [CLI setup and configuration](./cli-setup)
2. Review the [foundational concepts](./foundations)

### Choose Your Component Type

  </Card>

## Next Steps

Select the type of component you want to build and follow the corresponding guide:

1. **[Data Collection Components](./data-collection-developer-guide)** - For processing analytics events and sending data to external services
2. **[Edge Function Components](./edge-function-developer-guide)** - For path-based request handling and custom edge logic

Both guides will walk you through the complete development lifecycle from setup to deployment.
