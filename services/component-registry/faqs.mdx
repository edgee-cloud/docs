  <Accordion title="What is an edge component??">
    An edge component is a simple piece of business logic that runs at the edge, just before an HTML page is served to a visitor's browser.
    Depending on the page content, a component may invoke 3rd-party APIs, edit the HTML response, or manipulate HTTP headers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What tooling is available for local development and testing?">
    You can use the Edgee CLI to build and publish new components from your laptop.
    The Edgee CLI also acts as the reverse proxy you can use to serve and test components locally before pushing to the registry.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What programming languages can I use to develop a new component?">
    You can use all programming languages that compile to Wasm, with WASI and component support,
    such as C, C#, Go, JavaScript, Python, and Rust.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I keep a component private? And how do I make it public?">
    When creating and pushing a component for the first time, it will be set to private by default.
    You can easily make it public when pushing a new component to the registry, either via CLI or using the web console.
    Please keep in mind that public components cannot be unpublished (only deleted), so make sure you're 100% comfortable with
    your component being publicly visible when pushing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does my public component need to be open source?">
    All Edgee-native components are public and open source and we'd love to encourage all component developers to keep their
    projects open source as well. This allows you to build trust and encourages other developers to get involved with bugfixing
    and other maintenance tasks. That said, we understand there might be special cases where organizations are more comfortable with
    publishing closed-source components and the Edgee platforms supports that too.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need an Edgee account to create and publish components?">
    Yes, components are bound to your Edgee account or your organization's Edgee account.
    On the other hand, Edgee Open Source Edition users can use the Edgee Component Registry to pull and add public components
    to their proxy configuration as well.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the Edgee Component Registry for free?">
    Yes, the Edgee Component Registry is free of charge.
    With Edgee's managed service, you only get charged for the events and requests generated by your projects.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I use components published by other developers in my Edgee project?">
    You can easily add a component to your projects from a public component's page, simply click “Add to my project”.
    Alternatively, you can visit your project's dashboard and visit the “Registry” tab to list all public and private components available to you.
    Last but not least, you could use the [Edgee API](/api-reference/introduction) to automate every step, from project creation to component integration.
