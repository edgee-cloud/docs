The following concepts are a useful starting points before you start coding.

#### Reverse proxy
Edgee acts as a [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) in front of a website, intercepting HTTP requests and running business
logic on top of edge networks and CDNs such as Fastly and Cloudflare; the main proxy interacts with WebAssembly components
to implement features such as data collection for analytics, warehousing, and attribution data.

#### WebAssembly and language support
[WebAssembly (Wasm in short)](https://webassembly.org/) allows developers to implement a component in a programming language such as Rust or JavaScript
and compile it to a binary file; each component runs in a sandboxed environment with no access to network or filesystem (by default)
and implements a specific interface that the Edgee proxy will use to invoke a component's business logic.

You can use WebAssembly as compile target with [many different languages](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/language-support.html)
and the resulting binary file is language-agnostic and cross-platform. Today Edgee supports and provides tooling for
Rust, Go, Python, JavaScript, C#, and C. Even though the local development experience with the Edgee CLI is quite similar across languages,
it's worth noting that compiled languages such as Rust, Go, and C result in pretty small and efficient Wasm files (within hundreds of KBs),
while interpreted languages such as Python and JavaScript result in much heavier Wasm files (20MB+).

#### Component types and WIT
Today Edgee supports only one component type: `data_collection`. That includes components
for web analytics such as
[Google Analytics](/components/data-collection/google-analytics) or [Amplitude](/components/data-collection/amplitude),
for attribution/conversion such as
[Meta Conversions API](/components/data-collection/meta-capi) or [LinkedIn Conversions API](/components/data-collection/linkedin-capi),
and for data warehousing destinations such as Amazon S3 or Amazon Firehose.

We're quickly expanding to new component types such as `consent_mapping`
to integrate with CMPs (Consent Management Platforms) and `ab_testing` to integrate with A/B testing frameworks and services at the edge.

In Wasm, interfaces are defined with [WIT (Wasm Interface Type)](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html),
a definition language to define types and world. You can find [Edgee's WIT files on GitHub](https://github.com/edgee-cloud/edgee-wit).
The convention is to store them in each component project under a `wit/` folder and with a `wit/deps.toml` file to define your WIT dependencies
Under the hood, the Edgee CLI is using [wit-deps](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-deps) to keep the WIT dependencies up-to-date. When a new WIT file is released,
simply update the `wit/deps.toml` file with the new version and `wit-deps` will update the WIT dependencies. Depending on the programming language,
you might need to re-generate the WIT bindings for your code to run and compile properly.

#### Edgee CLI and APIs
You can use the [Edgee CLI](https://github.com/edgee-cloud/edgee) to create and build a Wasm component locally with commands such as 
`edgee component new` and `edgee component build`. 
When the component is ready, the Edgee CLI lets you push it to the Edgee Component Registry as a public or private component
under your organization's account, with `edgee component push`. Under the hood, the CLI interacts with the
[Edgee API](/api-reference/introduction) and its goal is to simplify the local development experience across all supported languages.
