Setting user consent status is a fundamental aspect of Edgee's privacy-first approach. 
Our [privacy framework](/introduction/privacy) is built around respecting user consent, 
which directly influences how we handle user identification and data anonymization. 
By properly configuring consent management, you ensure that Edgee's privacy protection mechanisms are correctly applied based on user preferences.

Edgee provides two distinct approaches for managing user consent, allowing you to choose the solution that best fits your existing infrastructure and requirements.

### 1. Edgee JavaScript SDK

The Edgee SDK provides a direct method for managing consent when you have your own consent management system in place.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Set consent to denied
edgee.consent("denied")
// Set consent to pending
edgee.consent("pending")
// Set consent to granted
edgee.consent("granted")
```

**Use Cases:**
- When you have built your own consent management system
- When you need direct control over consent management
- When you want to integrate consent management into your existing application logic

<Note>When user consent status is set via the SDK, Edgee stores and uses it for every subsequent component computation.</Note>

### 2. Consent Mapping Components

For customers who already have a Consent Management Platform (CMP) in place, Edgee provides Consent Mapping Components that integrate directly with 
popular CMP solutions ([Axeptio](/components/cmp/axeptio-consent-mapping), [Didomi](/components/cmp/didomi-consent-mapping), [OneTrust](/components/cmp/onetrust-consent-mapping), [CookieYes](/components/cmp/cookieyes-consent-mapping))

**How it Works:**
- The Consent Mapping Component automatically reads the user's consent status from your existing CMP
- Edgee maps the CMP's consent statuses to its internal consent management system
- No additional code is required beyond the initial component setup

**Benefits:**
- Seamless integration with existing CMP solutions
- No need to modify your current consent management workflow
- Automatic synchronization of consent statuses
- Reduced development overhead
