Caching is an important aspect of most web projects, it allows you to reach the best performance
and reduce load at your origin website.

When you activate caching, Edgee acts as a CDN (Content Delivery Network), caching content
based on response headers to help you deliver a faster user experience.

## Activate or disable caching

Browse to your project's **Performance** panel and select **Cache**.

From here, activating or disabling caching for your project is a one-click operation.
Simply click the toggle on the right hand side.

<Frame caption="How to activate or disable caching on Edgee. Click on the image to zoom in.">
    <img
        className="block dark:hidden"
        src="/images/caching-activate.png"
        alt="How to activate or disable caching on Edgee"
        dark:hidden
    />
    <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/caching-activate-dark.png"
        alt="How to activate or disable caching on Edgee"
    />
</Frame>

That's it! Now you can enjoy faster page loads.

## Supported HTTP headers

Edgee runs on [hundreds on PoPs (Points of Presence)](/introduction/network-map), where content is cached
to speed up your website.

The caching behavior depends on specific HTTP headers that you can send back as part of your responses to
set a specific TTL (Time to Live). If you enable caching without any explicit caching header,
the default TTL is `3600` seconds (1 hour).

Edgee supports the following caching headers:

- `Surrogate-Control`: instructs Edgee to set a maximum TTL, e.g. `max-age=31557600` (1 year TTL)
- `Cache-Control`: instructs the browser to set a maximum TTL, e.g. `no-store, max-age=0` (no client-side cache)
- `Expires`: instructs the browser to cache the response until the specified data, eg. `Wed, 23 October 2024 00:00:00 GMT`
- `Age`: indicates that an object has already spent some time in an upstream cache,
which will be subtracted by the response's `max-age` to compute the maximum TTL
- `ETag`: a unique version identifier that only changes after a resource is modified, e.g. `123dq37891dc-it21`
- `Vary`: indicates the list of headers that must match to consider a response cached, e.g. `Accept-Language, User-Agent`

<Note>
    Note: usually you want to set a long value for `Surrogate-Control` as Edgee can revalidate the origin response.
    On the other hand, you normally want to set a shorter value (or even zero) for client-side caching
    (unless it's a static resource that changes path at each deployment, like bundled JavaScript libraries).
