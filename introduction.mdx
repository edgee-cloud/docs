Edgee is a **unified AI Gateway** that sits between your application and LLM providers, giving you complete control over your AI infrastructure.

**One API. Every model. Total visibility.**

```typescript
import { Edgee } from '@edgee/sdk';

const edgee = new Edgee(process.env.EDGEE_API_KEY);

const response = await edgee.send({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  message: 'Hello, world!'
});
```

```python
import edgee

edgee.send(model='gpt-4', message='Hello, world!')
```

```go
import (
	"github.com/edgee/sdk"
)

edgee := sdk.NewEdgee(os.Getenv("EDGEE_API_KEY"))

response, err := edgee.Send(context.Background(), sdk.SendRequest{
```

```rust
use edgee::sdk::Edgee;

let edgee = Edgee::new(std::env::var("EDGEE_API_KEY").unwrap());

let response = edgee.send(SendRequest {
  model: "gpt-4".to_string(),
  message: "Hello, world!".to_string(),
});
```

That's it. You now have access to every major LLM provider, automatic failovers, cost tracking, and full observability, all through one simple API.

## Why Choose Edgee?

Building with LLMs is powerful, but comes with challenges:

- **Vendor lock-in**: Your code is tightly coupled to a single provider's API
- **Cost opacity**: Bills spike with no visibility into what's driving costs
- **No fallbacks**: When OpenAI goes down, your app goes down
- **Security concerns**: Sensitive data flows directly to third-party providers
- **Fragmented observability**: Logs scattered across multiple dashboards

**Edgee solves all of this with a single integration.**
