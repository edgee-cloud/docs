Edgee is a **unified AI Gateway** that sits between your application and LLM providers, giving you complete control over your AI infrastructure.

**One API. Every model. Total visibility.**

```typescript
import Edgee from 'edgee';
const edgee = new Edgee();

const response = await edgee.send({
  model: 'gpt-5.1',
  input: 'Hello, world!'
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from edgee import Edgee
client = Edgee()

response = client.send(
    model="gpt-5.1",
    input="Write a short bedtime story about a unicorn."
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```go
import "github.com/edgee-cloud/go-sdk"
edgee := edgee.NewEdgee()

response := edgee.Send(&edgee.SendRequest{
    Model: "gpt-5.1",
    Input: "Hello, world!",
})

println(response.OutputText)
```

```rust
use edgee::Edgee;

let edgee = Edgee::new();

let response = edgee.send(edgee::SendRequest {
    model: "gpt-5.1".to_string(),
    input: "Hello, world!".to_string(),
})?;

println!("{}", response.output_text);
```

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.edgee.ai/v1/send \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $EDGEE_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"model": "gpt-5.1", "input": "Hello, world!"}'
```

That's it. You now have access to every major LLM provider, automatic failovers, cost tracking, and full observability, all through one simple API.

## Why Choose Edgee?

Building with LLMs is powerful, but comes with challenges:

- **Vendor lock-in**: Your code is tightly coupled to a single provider's API
- **Cost opacity**: Bills spike with no visibility into what's driving costs
- **No fallbacks**: When OpenAI goes down, your app goes down
- **Security concerns**: Sensitive data flows directly to third-party providers
- **Fragmented observability**: Logs scattered across multiple dashboards

**Edgee solves all of this with a single integration.**
