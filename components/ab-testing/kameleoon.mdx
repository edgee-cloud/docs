[Kameleoon](https://www.kameleoon.com) is a unified experimentation platform for web and full-stack applications, enabling you to run A/B tests, manage feature flags, and personalize user experiences at scale.

<Info>
Kameleoon supports both web and server-side experimentation, with SDKs for JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more.
The Edgee Kameleoon component is designed to simplify integration for web and React projects.

## Getting Started

**To integrate Kameleoon into your Edgee project:**

<Steps>

<Step title="Open the Edgee Console">
Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's **Components** section.
</Step>

<Step title="Add the Kameleoon Component">
Click **Add a component** and search for `edgee/kameleoon`. Select the Kameleoon component from the list.
</Step>

<Step title="Set your Kameleoon Site Code">
Enter your Kameleoon Site Code (you can find this in your Kameleoon dashboard).
</Step>

<Step title="Configure SDK and Web Experiment Engine Injection">
Choose whether to automatically inject the Kameleoon SDK and/or the Web Experiment engine:

- **SDK Injection**: Adds the Kameleoon JavaScript SDK to your site automatically.
- **Web Experiment Engine**: Injects the engine required to run web-based experiments.

You can enable one or both depending on your use case.
</Step>

<Step title="Save the component">
Click **Save** to enable Kameleoon for your project.
</Step>

</Steps>

## SDK & Engine Proxifying

The Edgee Kameleoon component proxifies both the Kameleoon SDK and the Web Experiment Engine.
This means these scripts are always served from your Edgee domain instead of directly from Kameleoon's servers.

**Benefits:**
- **Better performance:** Assets can be cached and delivered faster from Edgee's infrastructure.
- **Adblock avoidance:** Proxied scripts are less likely to be blocked by adblockers or privacy tools.
