The [OneTrust Consent Management Platform](https://www.onetrust.com/products/consent-management/) helps you collect user consent on your website.

With this component, you no longer need to [specify your users' consent](/services/data-collection/consent)
via the Edgee SDK or Edgee Data Layer: everything is done automatically.

The consent status will be automatically set to `pending`, `granted`, or `denied` based on the OneTrust cookie.

## Getting Started

**To integrate OneTrust Consent Mapping into your Edgee project:**

1. From the Edgee console, go to your project and navigate to the Data Collection service.
2. Click on "Add Component" and select "OneTrust Consent Mapping".
3. Activate the component on the top right.
4. Confirm with "Add component" to complete the setup.
