description: Integrate user consent managed by Axeptio with your Edgee components.

import EdgeeSdk from '/snippets/edgee-sdk.mdx';

<EdgeeSdk />

[Axeptio](https://www.axept.io) helps you collect user consent on your website and build a positive consent experience.

With this component, you no longer need to [specify your users' consent](/services/data-collection/consent)
via the Edgee SDK or Edgee Data Layer: everything is done automatically.

The consent status will be automatically set to `pending`, `granted`, or `denied` based on the Axeptio cookie.

## Getting Started

**To integrate Axeptio Consent Mapping into your Edgee project:**

1. From the Edgee console, go to your project and navigate to the Data Collection service.
2. Click on "Add Component" and select "Axeptio Consent Mapping".
3. Activate the component on the top right.
4. Confirm with "Add component" to complete the setup.
