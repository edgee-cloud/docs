description: Integrate user consent managed by Axeptio with your Edgee components.

import EdgeeSdk from '/snippets/edgee-sdk.mdx';

<EdgeeSdk />

[Axeptio](https://www.axept.io) helps you collect user consent on your website and build a positive consent experience.

With this component, you no longer need to [specify your users' consent](/introduction/consent)
via the Edgee SDK or Edgee Data Layer: everything is done automatically.

The consent status will be automatically set to `pending`, `granted`, or `denied` based on the Axeptio cookie.

## Getting Started

**To integrate Axeptio Consent Mapping into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/axeptio-consent-mapping` from the list of available components.
3. Activate the component on the top right.
4. Confirm with "Add component" to complete the setup.
