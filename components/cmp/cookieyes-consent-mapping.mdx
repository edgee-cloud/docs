description: Integrate user consent managed by CookieYes with your Edgee components.

import EdgeeSdk from '/snippets/edgee-sdk.mdx';

<EdgeeSdk />


[CookieYes](https://www.cookieyes.com/) helps you automate consent management and manage cookie compliance.

With this component, you no longer need to [specify your users' consent](/services/data-collection/consent)
via the Edgee SDK or Edgee Data Layer: everything is done automatically.

The consent status will be automatically set to `pending`, `granted`, or `denied` based on the CookieYes cookie.

## Getting Started

**To integrate CookieYes Consent Mapping into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/cookieyes-consent-mapping` from the list of available components.
3. Activate the component on the top right.
4. Confirm with "Add component" to complete the setup.
