LinkedIn Conversions API (CAPI) allows you to send web events directly to LinkedIn from your server, ensuring reliable data tracking even with ad blockers or browser limitations. With Edgee's edge integration, you can now send these events directly from the edge, improving both reliability and performance.


## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to LinkedIn CAPI events:

| Edgee event | LinkedIn CAPI Event |
|-------------|----------------|
| Track       | URN of the conversion rule|


<Warning>
  LinkedIn Conversions API requires user identification data for event processing. Each event must include at least one of the following user properties:
  - Email

  Events without any user identification will be ignored by LinkedIn.
</Warning>

## User Identification

When you make a `user` call, Edgee stores the user's data (user_id, anonymous_id, and properties) on the device. This enables proper attribution for subsequent page views and events.


## Getting Started

**To integrate LinkedIn CAPI into your Edgee project:**

1. From the Edgee console, go to your project and navigate to the Data Collection service.
2. Click on "Add Component" and select "LinkedIn CAPI".
3. Enter the following credentials:
   - `LinkedIn Access Token`: Your LinkedIn CAPI access token
4. Click Save to complete the setup.

To know how to get your access token , visit the [LinkedIn Marketing API documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/ads-reporting/conversions-api).

## Destination name

When configuring the destination in your **Edgee Data Layer** or within SDK calls, use `linkedin_capi` as the component name:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "linkedin_capi": true
  }
}
```

## Testing Your Implementation

1. Create a conversion rule for your event https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/ads-reporting/conversions-api?view=li-lms-2024-11&tabs=http#create-a-conversion-rule
2. Add the conversion rule URN to your event payload
3. Send a test event through Edgee
4. Verify that the event is received by LinkedIn
