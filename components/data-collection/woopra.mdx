Woopra lets you analyze and visualize the entire customer journey, from first marketing touch to product usage.
Now you can use Woopra at the edge, without having to load the Woopra script on your website.
This is a huge win for privacy and performance.

## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to Woopra events:

| Edgee event | Woopra Event                   |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Page        | Track request with name = "pv" |
| Track       | Track request                  |
| User        | Identify request               |

## Getting Started

**To add Woopra to your project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/woopra` from the list of available components.
3. Enter the `Project name` associated with your Woopra project and click Save.
4. You can now start sending events to Woopra.

## Component Name

When specifying the component in the **Edgee Data Layer** or using SDK methods, please use `edgee/woopra` as the component name:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "edgee/woopra": true
  }
}
```
