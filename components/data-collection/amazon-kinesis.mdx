Amazon Kinesis Data Streams allow you to collect and process large streams of data records in real time. 
Kinesis is designed for rapid and continuous data intake and aggregation and it lets you ingest data into
other services such as Amazon Redshift or implement real-time processing with AWS Lambda.

## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to Amplitude events:

| Edgee event | Kinesis record    | Description    |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Page        | `full-event.json` | Full JSON dump |
| Track       | `full-event.json` | Full JSON dump |
| User        | `full-event.json` | Full JSON dump |


## Getting Started

**To integrate Amazon Kinesis into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Data Collection service.
2. Select "Add Component" and choose "Amazon Kinesis" from the list of available components.
3. Enter your AWS credentials, region, stream name/arn, optional partition, and click Save. <br />
5. Once the component has been configured, you are ready to send analysis events to Kinesis.

## Component Name

When configuring the component in your **Edgee Data Layer** or within SDK calls, use `edgee/amazon-kinesis` as the component name:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "edgee/amazon-kinesis": true
  }
}
```
