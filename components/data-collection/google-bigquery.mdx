[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse that enables scalable analysis over petabytes of data. It is a powerful solution for analytics and business intelligence.

## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to BigQuery records:
   Edgee Event | BigQuery Record | Description |
 |-------------|-----------------|-------------|
 | Page | A new record in the configured table | Full JSON dump of the Page event |
 | Track | A new record in the configured table | Full JSON dump of the Track event |
 | User | A new record in the configured table | Full JSON dump of the User event |

## Getting Started

**To integrate BigQuery into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/bigquery` from the list of available components.
3. Enter your BigQuery configuration and credentials, and click Save.
4. Create a new table in BigQuery with the correct schema (see next section).
5. Once the component has been configured, you are ready to send new records to BigQuery.

### Creating the BigQuery Table

Before ingesting events, you'll need to create a new table with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `your-project-id.your-dataset-id.your-table-id` (
    uuid STRING,
    event_type STRING,
    timestamp INT64,
    timestamp_millis INT64,
    timestamp_micros INT64,
    consent STRING,
    context JSON,
    data JSON
);
```

#### JSON Fields

New records are ingested individually using BigQuery's streaming API. If your BigQuery table supports JSON types, both context and data will contain additional JSON sub-fields, whose schema is automatically inferred at runtime.

Please note that:

    - The sub-fields under context are always the same, so you can use queries such as `SELECT context.client.ip AS ip FROM your-project-id.your-dataset-id.your-table-id`.
    - The sub-fields under data depend on the value of event_type, so you can use queries such as:
        - `SELECT data.track.name FROM your-project-id.your-dataset-id.your-table-id WHERE event_type = 'track'`
        - `SELECT data.page.path FROM your-project-id.your-dataset-id.your-table-id WHERE event_type = 'page'`

## Component Name

When configuring the component in your Edgee Data Layer or within SDK calls, use edgee/bigquery as the component name:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "edgee/bigquery": true
  }
}
```
