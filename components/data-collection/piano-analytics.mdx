Piano Analytics, known for its precise analytics and data management platform, can be integrated directly through Edgee, 
enabling you to harness its powerful analytics tools without the need for embedding any additional scripts on your site. 
This edge-based integration significantly boosts site performance while adhering to the highest standards of user privacy.

## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to Piano Analytics events:

| Edgee event | Piano Event     |
|-------------|----------------|
| Page        | `page.display`   |
| Track       | Name of the event |
| User        | -             |

<Note>
  The User event is not mapped to any Piano event. However, when you make a `user` call, 
  Edgee stores the user's data (user_id, anonymous_id, and properties) on the device. 
  This enables proper attribution for subsequent page views and events.
</Note>


## Getting Started

**To configure Piano Analytics in your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/piano-analytics` from the list of available components.
3. Input your Piano Analytics credentials:
   - `Site ID`
   - `Collection Domain`
4. Click Save to complete the setup.

## Destination Name

For correctly routing events in your **Edgee Data Layer** or via SDK function calls, refer to the component as `edgee/piano-analytics`.

```json
{
  "components": {
    "edgee/piano-analytics": true
  }
}
```
