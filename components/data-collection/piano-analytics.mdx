Piano Analytics, known for its precise analytics and data management platform, can be integrated directly through Edgee, 
enabling you to harness its powerful analytics tools without the need for embedding any additional scripts on your site. 
This edge-based integration significantly boosts site performance while adhering to the highest standards of user privacy.


## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to Piano Analytics events:

| Edgee event | Piano Event     |
|-------------|----------------|
| Page        | `page.display`   |
| Track       | Name of the event |
| User        | -             |

<Note>
  The User event is not mapped to any Piano event. However, when you make a `user` call, 
  Edgee stores the user's data (user_id, anonymous_id, and properties) on the device. 
  This enables proper attribution for subsequent page views and events.
</Note>


## Getting Started

**To configure Piano Analytics in your Edgee project:**

1. Access the Edgee console and select your project's Data Collection service.
2. Click on "Add Component" and select "Piano Analytics" from the available options.
3. Input your Piano Analytics credentials:
   - `Site ID`
   - `Collection Domain`
4. Click Save to complete the setup.

## Destination Name

For correctly routing events in your **Edgee Data Layer** or via SDK function calls, refer to the component as `edgee/piano-analytics`.

```json
{
  "components": {
    "edgee/piano-analytics": true
  }
}
```


## Native Cookie Support

Piano Analytics uses various cookies to track users across sessions. With Edgee's Native Cookie Support, 
these cookies can be managed directly at the edge.

To know more about the native cookie support, please refer to the [Native Cookie Support](/services/data-collection/native-cookie-support) documentation.

### Configuration

In your Piano Analytics component settings, configure the native cookie support:

<Frame caption="Go to your project > Data Collection > Your Piano Analytics component">
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/native-cookie-support-light.png"/>
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/native-cookie-support-dark.png"/>
</Frame>

The setting determines when the Piano Analytics cookies are set:

- **disabled**: Don't manage cookies at the edge (default)
- **safe**: Only set cookie after user grants consent
- **strong**: Set cookie unless user explicitly denies consent
- **always**: Set cookie regardless of consent status

<Warning>
  Using `strong` or `always` modes may not comply with privacy regulations in your jurisdiction (such as GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable laws). 
  By enabling these modes, you assume full responsibility for:
  - Ensuring compliance with all applicable privacy laws and regulations
  - Obtaining and managing necessary user consents
  - Implementing appropriate privacy notices and policies
  - Any legal consequences resulting from non-compliant cookie usage

  Edgee provides these features as technical capabilities only. We strongly recommend consulting with your legal team or privacy experts before implementing these modes.
</Warning>

Additionally, you need to select which cookie type to use:

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/piano-cookie-type-light.png"/>
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/piano-cookie-type-dark.png"/>
</Frame>

- **_pcid**: Piano client side cookie with browser ID (recommended for most use cases)
- **_pcid + _pprv**: Piano client side cookie with browser ID and privacy settings
- **atid**: Simple UUID cookie 
- **atuserid**: Legacy AT Internet cookie

Then, you can specify the domain of the cookie (optional):

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/piano-cookie-domain-light.png"/>
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/piano-cookie-domain-dark.png"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
  If you have any doubts about which cookie type to use or the domain of the cookie, please contact us at [support@edgee.com](mailto:support@edgee.com).
