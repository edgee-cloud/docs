ClickHouse is an open-source columnar database that allows you to generate analytical reports using SQL queries in real-time.

## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to ClickHouse records:

| Edgee Event | ClickHouse record | Description |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Page        | A new record in the configured table | Full JSON dump of the Page event |
| Track       | A new record in the configured table | Full JSON dump of the Track event |
| User        | A new record in the configured table | Full JSON dump of the User event |


## Getting Started

**To integrate ClickHouse into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/clickhouse` from the list of available components.
3. Enter your ClickHouse configuration and credentials, and click Save. <br />
5. Once the component has been configured, you are ready to send new records to ClickHouse.

## Component Name

When configuring the component in your **Edgee Data Layer** or within SDK calls, use `edgee/clickhouse` as the component name:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "edgee/clickhouse": true
  }
}
```
