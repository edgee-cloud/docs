ClickHouse is an open-source columnar database that allows you to generate analytical reports using SQL queries in real-time.

## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to ClickHouse records:

| Edgee Event | ClickHouse record | Description |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Page        | A new record in the configured table | Full JSON dump of the Page event |
| Track       | A new record in the configured table | Full JSON dump of the Track event |
| User        | A new record in the configured table | Full JSON dump of the User event |


## Getting Started

**To integrate ClickHouse into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/clickhouse` from the list of available components.
3. Enter your ClickHouse configuration and credentials, and click Save. <br />
4. Create a new table in ClickHouse with the correct schema (see next section).
5. Once the component has been configured, you are ready to send new records to ClickHouse.


### Creating the ClickHouse Table

Before ingesting events, you'll ned to create a new table with the following schema, depending on your ClickHouse version and `JSON` support:


<CodeGroup>

```sql native JSON
CREATE TABLE edgee (
    uuid UUID,
    event_type String,
    timestamp UInt64,
    timestamp_millis UInt64,
    timestamp_micros UInt64,
    consent Nullable(String),
    context JSON, # defined as JSON type
    data JSON     # defined as JSON type
) ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (timestamp_millis);
```

```sql experimental JSON
SET enable_json_type = 1; # you need to enable json type explicitly
CREATE TABLE edgee (
    uuid UUID,
    event_type String,
    timestamp UInt64,
    timestamp_millis UInt64,
    timestamp_micros UInt64,
    consent Nullable(String),
    context JSON, # defined as JSON type
    data JSON     # defined as JSON type
) ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (timestamp_millis);
```

```sql experimental Object('json')
SET allow_experimental_object_type = 1;  # you need to enable object type explicitly
CREATE TABLE edgee (
    uuid UUID,
    event_type String,
    timestamp UInt64,
    timestamp_millis UInt64,
    timestamp_micros UInt64,
    consent Nullable(String),
    context Object('json'),  # defined as Object type
    data Object('json')      # defined as Object type
) ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (timestamp_millis);
```

```sql no JSON support
CREATE TABLE edgee (
    uuid UUID,
    event_type String,
    timestamp UInt64,
    timestamp_millis UInt64,
    timestamp_micros UInt64,
    consent Nullable(String),
    context String,  # defined as String type
    data String      # defined as String type
) ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (timestamp_millis);
```

</CodeGroup>


#### JSON fields

New records are ingested individually using `JSONEachRow`.

If your ClickHouse version supports `JSON` or `Object('json')` types, both `context` and `data` will contain additional JSON sub-fields, whose schema is automatically inferred at runtime.


Please note that:

- The sub-fields under `context` are always the same, so you can use queries such as `SELECT context.client.ip AS ip FROM edgee`
- The sub-fields under `data` depend on the value of `event_type`, so you can use queries such as:
  - `SELECT data.Track.name FROM edgee WHERE event_type = 'Track'`
  - `SELECT data.Page.path FROM edgee WHERE event_type = 'Page'`


## Component Name

When configuring the component in your **Edgee Data Layer** or within SDK calls, use `edgee/clickhouse` as the component name:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "edgee/clickhouse": true
  }
}
```
