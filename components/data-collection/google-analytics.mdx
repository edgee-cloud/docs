Google Analytics 4 is now available at the edge. This means you can use Google Analytics 4 without 
having to load the Google Analytics 4 script on your website. This is a huge win for privacy and performance.


## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to Google Analytics events:

| Edgee event | GA Event     |
|-------------|----------------|
| Page        | `page_view`      |
| Track       | Name of the event |
| User        | -              |

<Note>
  The User event is not mapped to any Google Analytics event. However, when you make a `user` call, 
  Edgee stores the user's data (user_id, anonymous_id, and properties) on the device. 
  This enables proper attribution for subsequent page views and events.
</Note>


## Getting Started

**To add Google Analytics to your project:**

1. From the Edgee console, go to your project and go to the Data Collection service.
2. Click on "Add Destination" and choose "Google Analytics".
3. Enter the `Measurement ID` and the `API Secret` associated with your GA4 stream and click Save. <br />
_(To create a new API Secret, navigate in the Google Analytics UI to Admin > Data Streams > choose your stream > Measurement Protocol > Create)_
4. You can now start sending events to Google Analytics.

## Destination Name

When specifying the destination in the **Edgee Data Layer** or using SDK methods, please use `edgee/google-analytics` as the component name:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "edgee/google-analytics": true
  }
}
```

## How to measure ecommerce events with Google Analytics component

The Google Analytics component supports all standard GA4 ecommerce events. 
Here's how to implement ecommerce tracking using the Edgee Data Layer:

### With the Edgee Data Layer

To track ecommerce events from the edge, add them to your Edgee Data Layer like this:

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_DATA_LAYER__" type="application/json">
{
  "data_collection": {
    "events": [
      {
        "type": "track",
        "data": {
          "name": "view_item",
          "properties": {
            "currency": "USD",
            "value": 30.03,
            "products": [
              {
                "sku": "SKU_12345",
                "name": "Stan and Friends Tee",
                "affiliation": "Google Merchandise Store",
                "coupon": "SUMMER_FUN",
                "discount": 2.22,
                "index": 0,
                "brand": "Google",
                "category": "Apparel",
                "category2": "Adult",
                "category3": "Shirts",
                "category4": "Crew",
                "category5": "Short sleeve",
                "list_id": "related_products",
                "list_name": "Related Products",
                "variant": "green",
                "location_id": "ChIJIQBpAG2ahYAR_6128GcTUEo",
                "price": 10.01,
                "quantity": 3
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
</script>
```

### With the Edgee SDK

If you want to track ecommerce events from the client, you can use the Edgee SDK.

```javascript
edgee.track({
    "name": "view_item",
    "properties": {
      "currency": "USD",
      "value": 30.03,
      "products": [
        {
          "sku": "SKU_12345",
          "name": "Stan and Friends Tee",
          "affiliation": "Google Merchandise Store",
          "coupon": "SUMMER_FUN",
          "discount": 2.22,
          "index": 0,
          "brand": "Google",
          "category": "Apparel",
          "category2": "Adult",
          "category3": "Shirts",
          "category4": "Crew",
          "category5": "Short sleeve",
          "list_id": "related_products",
          "list_name": "Related Products",
          "variant": "green",
          "location_id": "ChIJIQBpAG2ahYAR_6128GcTUEo",
          "price": 10.01,
          "quantity": 3
        }
      ]
    }
});
```

## Supported Ecommerce Events

The component supports all standard GA4 ecommerce events:

1. **View Item List & Selection**
   - `view_item_list`: When displaying a list of products
   - `select_item`: When a user clicks on a product in a list

2. **Product Views & Cart Actions**
   - `view_item`: When a user views product details
   - `add_to_cart`: When adding items to cart
   - `remove_from_cart`: When removing items from cart
   - `view_cart`: When viewing the shopping cart
   - `add_to_wishlist`: When adding items to a wishlist

3. **Checkout Process**
   - `begin_checkout`: Start of checkout process
   - `add_shipping_info`: When shipping information is added
   - `add_payment_info`: When payment information is added

4. **Purchase & Refund**
   - `purchase`: When a transaction is completed
   - `refund`: When a refund is issued

5. **Promotions**
   - `view_promotion`: When a promotion is viewed
   - `select_promotion`: When a promotion is clicked

<Note>
  Don't forget to use a `track` event, with the `name` property set to the event name.
  For example, to track a `purchase` event, you need to use a `track` event with the `name` property set to `purchase`.
</Note>

## Properties

Each ecommerce event requires specific parameters. Use the `properties` object to pass the parameters to Google Analytics.

- `currency`: The currency code (e.g., "USD")
- `value`: The monetary value of the transaction
- `transaction_id`: The transaction ID
- `tax`: The tax amount
- `shipping`: The shipping amount
- `coupon`: The coupon code

  - `sku`: Product SKU
  - `name`: Product name
  - `affiliation`: Product affiliation
  - `coupon`: Product coupon
  - `discount`: Product discount
  - `index`: Product index
  - `brand`: Product brand
  - `category`: Product category
  - `category2`: Product category 2
  - `category3`: Product category 3
  - `category4`: Product category 4

## Create product-scoped custom parameters

You can define custom product parameters by simply adding them to a `product` object.

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "sku": "SKU_12345",
      "...": "...",
      "color": "green",
      "size": "M"
    }
  ]
}
```


## Example: Complete Purchase Event

```json
{
  "data_collection": {
    "events": [
      {
        "type": "track",
        "data": {
          "name": "purchase",
          "properties": {
