description: Build better products by turning your user data into meaningful insights, using Amplitude's digital analytics platform, **now at the edge**.

Amplitude, a comprehensive product analytics platform, is seamlessly integrated with Edgee, allowing you to leverage 
its robust analytics capabilities directly from the edge. This component bypasses the need for embedding Amplitude's SDK directly into your site, 
offering significant improvements in privacy and website performance.

Edgee uses Amplitude's HTTP API to send events directly to Amplitude, ensuring secure and direct data transmission from the edge to Amplitude.

<Note>
  Amplitude component accepts `page`, `identify`, and `track` events.

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Data Collection service.
2. Select "Add Component" and choose "Amplitude" from the list of available components.
3. Enter your Amplitude `API Key` and click Save. <br />
_(Your API Key can be found in the Amplitude Dashboard under Settings > Organization Settings > Project Settings > General > API Keys.)_
4. Once the component has been configured, you are ready to send analysis events to Amplitude..


## Destination name

When configuring the destination in your **Context Payload** or within SDK calls, use `Amplitude` as the destination name to ensure accurate data routing.

```json
{
  "destinations": {
    "Amplitude": true
  }
}
```
