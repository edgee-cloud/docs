Amplitude, a comprehensive product analytics platform, is seamlessly integrated with Edgee, allowing you to leverage 
its robust analytics capabilities directly from the edge. This component bypasses the need for embedding Amplitude's SDK directly into your site, 
offering significant improvements in privacy and website performance.


## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to Amplitude events:

| Edgee event | Amplitude Event     |
|-------------|----------------|
| Page        | `[Amplitude] Page Viewed` _(and session_start/session_end if needed)_ |
| Track       | Name of the event |
| User        | `identify` |

<Note>
  When you make a `user` call, Edgee will send an `identify` event to Amplitude.
  Additionally, the user's data (user_id, anonymous_id, and properties) are stored on the device,
  enabling proper attribution for subsequent page views and events.
</Note>


## Getting Started

**To integrate Amplitude into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Data Collection service.
2. Select "Add Component" and choose "Amplitude" from the list of available components.
3. Enter your Amplitude `API Key` and click Save. <br />
_(Your API Key can be found in the [Amplitude Dashboard](https://app.amplitude.com/analytics/assembly-sh/settings/projects) 
under Settings > Organization Settings > Project Settings > General > API Keys)_
4. Once the component has been configured, you are ready to send analysis events to Amplitude.

## Destination Name

When configuring the destination in your **Edgee Data Layer** or within SDK calls, use `amplitude` as the component name:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "amplitude": true
  }
}
```

For more details on Amplitude implementation, refer to the 
[official Amplitude documentation](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/).
