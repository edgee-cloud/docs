Amplitude, a comprehensive product analytics platform, is seamlessly integrated with Edgee, allowing you to leverage 
its robust analytics capabilities directly from the edge. This component bypasses the need for embedding Amplitude's SDK directly into your site, 
offering significant improvements in privacy and website performance.


## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to Amplitude events:

| Edgee event | Amplitude Event     |
|-------------|----------------|
| Page        | `[Amplitude] Page Viewed` _(and session_start/session_end if needed)_ |
| Track       | Name of the event |
| User        | `identify` |

<Note>
  When you make a `user` call, Edgee will send an `identify` event to Amplitude.
  Additionally, the user's data (user_id, anonymous_id, and properties) are stored on the device,
  enabling proper attribution for subsequent page views and events.
</Note>


## Getting Started

**To integrate Amplitude into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Data Collection service.
2. Select "Add Component" and choose "Amplitude" from the list of available components.
3. Enter your Amplitude `API Key` and click Save. <br />
_(Your API Key can be found in the [Amplitude Dashboard](https://app.amplitude.com/analytics/assembly-sh/settings/projects) 
under Settings > Organization Settings > Project Settings > General > API Keys)_
4. Choose how Amplitude native cookies are handled. Turn them off completely, enable them always, or only enable them when user consent is granted.
5. Once the component has been configured, you are ready to send analysis events to Amplitude.

## Component Name

When configuring the component in your **Edgee Data Layer** or within SDK calls, use `edgee/amplitude` as the component name:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "edgee/amplitude": true
  }
}
```

## Native Cookie Support

Amplitude uses a device ID cookie (`AMP_[API_KEY]`) to track users across sessions. With Edgee's Native Cookie Support, 
this cookie can be managed directly at the edge.

To know more about the native cookie support, please refer to the [Native Cookie Support](/services/data-collection/native-cookie-support) documentation.

### Configuration

In your Amplitude component settings, configure the native cookie support:

<Frame caption="Go to your project > Data Collection > Your Amplitude component">
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/native-cookie-support-light.png"/>
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/native-cookie-support-dark.png"/>
</Frame>

The setting determines when the Amplitude device ID cookie is set:

- **disabled**: Don't manage cookies at the edge (default)
- **safe**: Only set cookie after user grants consent
- **strong**: Set cookie unless user explicitly denies consent
- **always**: Set cookie regardless of consent status

<Warning>
  Using `strong` or `always` modes may not comply with privacy regulations in your jurisdiction (such as GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable laws). 
  By enabling these modes, you assume full responsibility for:
  - Ensuring compliance with all applicable privacy laws and regulations
  - Obtaining and managing necessary user consents
  - Implementing appropriate privacy notices and policies
  - Any legal consequences resulting from non-compliant cookie usage

  Edgee provides these features as technical capabilities only. We strongly recommend consulting with your legal team or privacy experts before implementing these modes.
</Warning>
