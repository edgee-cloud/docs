Amazon Data Firehose allows you to reliably ingest, transform, and stream data into data lakes,
warehouses, and analytics services on Amazon Web Services.

## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to Amplitude events:

| Edgee event | Firehose record   | Description    |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Page        | `full-event.json` | Full JSON dump |
| Track       | `full-event.json` | Full JSON dump |
| User        | `full-event.json` | Full JSON dump |


## Getting Started

**To integrate Amazon Data Firehose into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Data Collection service.
2. Select "Add Component" and choose "Amazon Data Firehose" from the list of available components.
3. Enter your AWS credentials, region, stream name, and click Save. <br />
5. Once the component has been configured, you are ready to send analysis events to Firehose.

## Component Name

When configuring the component in your **Edgee Data Layer** or within SDK calls, use `edgee/amazon-data-firehose` as the component name:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "edgee/amazon-data-firehose": true
  }
}
```
