Eulerian Analytics component allowing to integrate the [Eulerian Marketing Platform](https://www.eulerian.com/) through the Edgee platform : 
100% privacy by design, data sovereignty, analytics, attribution, user segmentation & data activation.

## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to Eulerian events:

| Edgee event | Eulerian Event  |
|-------------|------------------|
| Page        | `page`
| Track       | Your event name  |
| User        | `user`       |

<Note>
  When you make a `user` call, Edgee will send a `user` event to Eulerian.
  Additionally, the user's data (user_id, anonymous_id, and properties) are stored on the device,
  enabling proper attribution for subsequent page views and events.
</Note>


## Getting Started

**To integrate Eulerian into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `eulerian-technologies/eulerian-analytics` from the list of available components.
3. Enter your your Eulerian `Tracking Domain Target`.
4. Enter a `Name of the website` and click Save.
6. Once the component has been configured, you are ready to send events to Eulerian.

## Component Name

When configuring the component in your **Edgee Data Layer** or within SDK calls, use `eulerian-technologies/eulerian-analytics` as the component name:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "eulerian-technologies/eulerian-analytics": true
  }
}
```

For more details on Eulerian implementation, refer to the 
[official Eulerian documentation](https://www.eulerian.com/).
