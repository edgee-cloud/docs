Plausible is intuitive, lightweight and open source web analytics.
It works without cookies and is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR.
Made and hosted in the EU, powered by European-owned cloud infrastructure.

This component eliminates the need to embed Plausible's snippet on your website, 
offering improvements in privacy and website performance.

## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to Plausible events:

| Edgee event | Plausible Event  |
|-------------|------------------|
| Page        | `pageview`
| Track       | Your event name  |
| User        | `user`       |

<Note>
  When you make a `user` call, Edgee will send a `user` event to Plausible.
  Additionally, the user's data (user_id, anonymous_id, and properties) are stored on the device,
  enabling proper attribution for subsequent page views and events.
</Note>


## Getting Started

**To integrate Plausible into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/plausible` from the list of available components.
3. Optionally, enter your your Plausible self-hosted `Instance URL`.
4. Enter your Plausible `Domain` and click Save.
6. Once the component has been configured, you are ready to send events to Plausible.

## Component Name

When configuring the component in your **Edgee Data Layer** or within SDK calls, use `edgee/plausible` as the component name:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "edgee/plausible": true
  }
}
```
