**Matomo** (formerly Piwik) is a leading open-source analytics platform focused on data privacy and user control. With Matomo, you can measure website traffic, understand user behavior, and track goals and campaigns â€” all without compromising user privacy.

This component allows you to send analytics data to your Matomo instance directly from the edge, improving reliability and respecting privacy regulations.

## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to Matomo tracking parameters:

| Edgee Event | Matomo Parameters | Description |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Page        | `action_name`, `url`, `urlref` | Tracks a pageview with optional referrer and metadata |
| Track       | `e_c`, `e_a`, `e_n`, `e_v` | Custom event tracking with category, action, name, and value |
| User        | `uid` or `cid`, `_cvar`     | Identifies the user and sends user-level metadata |

## Getting Started

**To integrate Matomo into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/matomo` from the list.
3. Enter your Matomo Site ID, Endpoint URL, and optionally an `Authentication Token` if you want to enable tracking of sensitive data (like IP, location).
4. Click **Save**.
5. Once configured, events will be sent to your Matomo instance in real-time from the edge.

## Component Name

When configuring the component in your **Edgee Data Layer** or within SDK calls, use `edgee/matomo` as the component name:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "edgee/matomo": true
  }
}
```
