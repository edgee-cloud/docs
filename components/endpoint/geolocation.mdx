The Geolocation component is an endpoint microservice that provides real-time geolocation data based on the user's IP address. 
This lightweight HTTP service runs at the edge, offering fast and accurate location information without requiring additional backend infrastructure.

## What is the Geolocation Component?

The Geolocation component is an endpoint component that:
- Responds to HTTP requests with geolocation data
- Provides continent, country, region, city, and IP information
- Runs at the edge for optimal performance
- Returns JSON responses with CORS support
- Requires no additional backend infrastructure

## Getting Started

**To integrate the Geolocation component into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/geolocation` from the list of available components.
3. Configure the endpoint path pattern (e.g., `/apigeo` or `/geolocation`).
4. Click Save to deploy the component.

Once configured, the component will respond to requests at your specified path with geolocation data.

## API Response

The component returns a JSON response with the following structure:

```json
{
  "continent": "NA",
  "country_name": "united states",
  "country_code": "US",
  "region": "TX",
  "city": "huntsville",
  "ip": "203.0.113.1"
}
```

## Usage Examples

### JavaScript Fetch Request
```javascript
fetch('/apigeo')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log('User location:', data.city, data.country_name);
  });
```

### cURL Request
```bash
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/geo
```

## Configuration

### Path Pattern
Configure the URL path where the geolocation service will be available. For example:
- `/apigeo` - Responds to requests at `yourdomain.com/apigeo`
- `/geolocation` - Responds to requests at `yourdomain.com/geolocation`
- `/location` - Responds to requests at `yourdomain.com/location`

## Key Features

- **Real-time Data**: Provides current geolocation based on IP address
- **Edge Performance**: Runs at the edge for minimal latency
- **CORS Support**: Includes proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- **No Cache**: Returns fresh data with `no-store` cache control
- **JSON Format**: Clean, structured JSON responses
- **Serverless**: No backend infrastructure required

## Use Cases

The Geolocation component is perfect for:
- **Content Localization**: Serve region-specific content based on user location
- **Analytics**: Track user geographic distribution
- **Compliance**: Determine applicable privacy regulations based on location
- **Personalization**: Customize user experience based on geographic data
- **Security**: Implement location-based access controls

## Response Headers

The component automatically sets the following headers:
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `Cache-Control: private, no-store`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

## Performance

As an endpoint component running at the edge, the Geolocation service provides:
- **Sub-10ms response times** in most cases
- **Global availability** through Edgee's edge network
- **Automatic scaling** based on demand
- **Zero maintenance** - no servers to manage
