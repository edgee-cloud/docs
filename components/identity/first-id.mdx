First ID is a powerful solution that enables you to identify and recognize your consented users across all your websites, devices, and browsers without being dependent on email or third-party cookies. 
With the increasing restrictions on third-party cookies (up to 90% of users becoming invisible), First ID provides a deterministic and persistent identification solution.

## What is First ID?

First ID allows you to:
- Identify and recognize all your consented users
- Work across all domains, devices, and browsers
- Operate without relying on email or third-party cookies
- Maintain GDPR compliance with user consent management
- Provide deterministic and persistent identification

## Getting Started

**To integrate First ID into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `first-id/first-id` from the list of available components.
3. Configure the component settings:

  The component offers several configuration options:

  - **Consent Mode**: Controls when the First ID is set
    - **safe**: Only set ID after user grants consent (default)
    - **strong**: Set ID unless user explicitly denies consent
    - **always**: Set ID regardless of consent status

<Warning>
  Using `strong` or `always` modes may not comply with privacy regulations in your jurisdiction (such as GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable laws). 
  By enabling these modes, you assume full responsibility for:
  - Ensuring compliance with all applicable privacy laws and regulations
  - Obtaining and managing necessary user consents
  - Implementing appropriate privacy notices and policies
  - Any legal consequences resulting from non-compliant identification

  Edgee provides these features as technical capabilities only. We strongly recommend consulting with your legal team or privacy experts before implementing these modes.
</Warning>

## Key Features

- **Deterministic Identification**: Precise and persistent identifiers based on strong signal combinations
- **Cross-Domain & Cross-Device**: Compatible with all browsers and devices
- **Interoperable**: Works with all your marketing and advertising tools
- **Partner Sovereignty**: You control the creation and transfer of your first-party cookie
- **GDPR Compliance**: User consent management, opt-out handling, and anonymous ID support

## Use Cases

First ID is particularly valuable for:
- **Advertisers**: Unify and enrich first-party data for precise user identification and personalization
- **Publishers/Media**: Increase audience volume and value without relying on email or third-party cookies
- **Agencies**: Optimize targeting and audience planning for better campaign reach and impact
- **AdTech**: Maximize tool interoperability while maintaining GDPR compliance
