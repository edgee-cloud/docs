Amplitude uses a device ID cookie (`AMP_[API_KEY]`) to track users across sessions. With Amplitude Native Cookies component, 
this cookie can be managed directly at the edge.

To know more about the native cookie support, please refer to the [Native Cookies](/services/data-collection/native-cookies) documentation.

## Getting Started

**To integrate Amplitude Native Cookies into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/amplitude-native-cookies` from the list of available components.
3. In your component settings, configure the mode:

  <Frame caption="Go to your project > Components > Your Amplitude Native Cookies component">
    <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/native-cookie-support-light.png"/>
    <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/native-cookie-support-dark.png"/>
  </Frame>

  The setting determines when the Amplitude device ID cookie is set:

  - **safe**: Only set cookie after user grants consent (default)
  - **strong**: Set cookie unless user explicitly denies consent
  - **always**: Set cookie regardless of consent status
  
<Warning>
  Using `strong` or `always` modes may not comply with privacy regulations in your jurisdiction (such as GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable laws). 
  By enabling these modes, you assume full responsibility for:
  - Ensuring compliance with all applicable privacy laws and regulations
  - Obtaining and managing necessary user consents
  - Implementing appropriate privacy notices and policies
  - Any legal consequences resulting from non-compliant cookie usage

  Edgee provides these features as technical capabilities only. We strongly recommend consulting with your legal team or privacy experts before implementing these modes.
</Warning>

4. Then, configure the cookie name:

Amplitude cookie name generally starts with `AMP_`.
To know more about the cookie name, please refer to the [Amplitude documentation](https://amplitude.com/docs/get-started/cookies-and-consent-management#amplitude-cookies).




For more details on Amplitude implementation, refer to the
