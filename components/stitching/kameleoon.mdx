[Kameleoon](https://www.kameleoon.com) is a unified experimentation platform for web and full-stack applications, enabling you to run A/B tests, manage feature flags, and personalize user experiences at scale.

<Info>
Kameleoon supports both web and server-side experimentation, with SDKs for JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more.
The Kameleoon component is designed to simplify integration for web and React projects.

## Getting Started

**To integrate Kameleoon into your Edgee project:**

<Steps>

<Step title="Open the Edgee Console">
Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's **Components** section.
</Step>

<Step title="Add the Kameleoon Component">
Click **Add a component** and search for `edgee/kameleoon`. Select the Kameleoon component from the list.
</Step>

<Step title="Set your Kameleoon Site Code">
Enter your Kameleoon Site Code (you can find this in your Kameleoon dashboard).
</Step>

<Step title="Configure SDK and Web Experiment Engine Injection">
Choose whether to automatically inject the Kameleoon SDK and/or the Web Experiment engine:

- **SDK Injection**: Adds the Kameleoon JavaScript SDK for feature flags to your site automatically.
- **Web Experiment Engine**: Injects the engine required to run web-based experiments automatically.

You can enable one or both depending on your use case.
</Step>

<Step title="Save the component">
Click **Save** to enable Kameleoon for your project.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Serving Kameleoon as 1st-party scripts and APIs

The Kameleoon component serves both the Kameleoon SDK and the Web Experiment Engine as 1st-party scripts,
from your website's domain instead of Kameleoon's servers.
Additionally, all API calls from the browser to Kameleoon's servers are served as 1st-party APIs from your website's domain,
including data calls and image requests.

Last but not least, the component automatically keeps the feature flags configuration in sync with Kameleoon's servers in the background,
ensuring that your application always has the latest flag values available without needing to fetch them dynamically from the browser.

Note: the feature flag configuration request alone can take up to 600ms on a slow 4G connection, greatly impacting the user experience.

**Benefits:**
- **Adblock avoidance:** 1st-party scripts and APIs are less likely to be blocked by adblockers or privacy tools,
allowing you to increase the effectiveness and quality of your A/B tests.
- **Enhanced user experience:** No need to fetch your feature flags configuration from the browser.
This results in less waiting time, both on first visit and after each refresh interval,
and allows you to **avoid flickering** or delays in feature flag evaluation.
- **Frequent flag updates:** Edgee transparently refreshes your flags configuration as often as **every 10 minutes** (compared to the default 1-hour refresh interval),
ensuring your latest flag values are always available quickly and without increasing flicker frequency.
