A simple maintenance page component that serves a maintenance page directly at the edge. This WebAssembly component can be mapped to your root website or specific sub-paths, providing a reliable way to display maintenance information even when your backend services are unavailable.

## Features

- **Edge-Native**: Serves maintenance pages directly from the edge
- **Flexible Path Matching**: Configure exact paths or path prefixes
- **WebAssembly Performance**: Fast loading through optimized Wasm deployment
- **Simple Configuration**: Easy setup through edgee.toml
- **Reliable Availability**: Functions independently of backend infrastructure

## Getting Started

**To add a maintenance page to your project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `maintenance-page` from the list of available edge functions.
3. Configure the following settings:
   - **Path Configuration**: Set exact path (`/maintenance`) or path prefix (`/`) matching
   - **Component Settings**: Configure any additional component-specific options
4. Click Save to activate the maintenance page.

## Configuration Options

### Path Settings
- **Exact Path**: Serve maintenance page only at a specific path (e.g., `/maintenance`)
- **Path Prefix**: Serve maintenance page for all paths matching a prefix (e.g., `/` for all paths)

**Note**: Only one path setting can be used at a time.

### Common Configurations
- **Site-wide maintenance**: Use path prefix `/` to serve maintenance page for all paths
- **Specific page maintenance**: Use exact path `/maintenance` for a dedicated maintenance page
- **Section maintenance**: Use path prefix `/admin` for maintenance on admin sections only


## Use Cases

1. **Scheduled Maintenance**: Display during planned system updates
2. **Emergency Outages**: Quick deployment during unexpected issues

<Note>
  The maintenance page edge function runs independently of your backend infrastructure, 
  ensuring it remains available even during complete system outages.
