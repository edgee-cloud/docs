[Didomi](https://www.didomi.io/consent-management-platform) helps you collect user consent on your website and comply with international data privacy regulations.

With this component, you no longer need to [specify your users' consent](/services/consent/overview)
via the Edgee SDK or Edgee Data Layer: everything is done automatically.

The consent status will be automatically set to `pending`, `granted`, or `denied` based on the Didomi cookie.

## Getting Started

**To integrate Didomi into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/didomi` from the list of available components.
3. Activate the component on the top right.
4. Confirm with "Add component" to complete the setup.


## Activate Didomi Gateway

Edgee offers a Gateway for Didomi, which allows you to use the Didomi resources on your own domain and prevents ad blockers from detecting and blocking the Didomi resources.

In order to use the Didomi Gateway, you need to activate it the component settings. Configure the following settings:

### Enable Gateway
Enable the Didomi Gateway to serve Didomi resources from your own domain, helping prevent ad blockers from detecting and blocking them.

</Frame>

As soon as the option is enabled, you can configure the other settings.


### Path Prefix
Specify a custom path prefix for your Didomi SDK and API calls. This helps prevent ad blockers from detecting and blocking the tag.

For example: `/didomi`, but we suggest you to use a random path prefix to avoid conflicts with other components and to avoid ad blockers from detecting and blocking Didomi resources.

### Didomi Public API Key
Enter your Didomi Public API Key, which can be found in the Didomi Console under the Embedding section when editing a widget.

For example: `f9b4c6b2-7c8e-43fd-9c79-f1fc18663cf0`

### Target
Optional: Enter your notice ID if using a specific consent notice. This can be found in the URL when editing a consent notice in your Didomi Console.

For example: If your URL is `https://console.didomi.io/didomi/widgets/notices/TQnRn8sr/embed`, the notice ID would be `TQnRn8sr`

### GDPR Applies
Specify whether GDPR applies to your website.

### Automatic SDK Injection
Choose whether to automatically inject the Didomi SDK into your website. If disabled, you'll need to add the SDK code manually.

## Manual SDK Integration

If you've disabled automatic SDK injection, you'll need to modify the Didomi SDK in your website code to work with the Gateway.
Follow the instructions in the Edgee console and refer to the [Didomi documentation](https://developers.didomi.io/cmp/web-sdk) for more details.
