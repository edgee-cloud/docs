The [OneTrust Consent Management Platform](https://www.onetrust.com/products/consent-management/) helps you collect user consent on your website.

With this component, you no longer need to [specify your users' consent](/services/consent/overview)
via the Edgee SDK or Edgee Data Layer: everything is done automatically.

The consent status will be automatically set to `pending`, `granted`, or `denied` based on the OneTrust cookie.

## Getting Started

**To integrate OneTrust Consent Mapping into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/onetrust-consent-mapping` from the list of available components.
3. Activate the component on the top right.
4. Confirm with "Add component" to complete the setup.
