[Osano](https://www.osano.com) is an intuitive data privacy platform that helps organizations manage privacy compliance across multiple regulations and jurisdictions, including cookie consent management for data privacy laws in over 50 countries.

With this component, you no longer need to [specify your users' consent](/services/consent/overview)
via the Edgee SDK or Edgee Data Layer: everything is done automatically.

The consent status will be automatically set to `pending`, `granted`, or `denied` based on evaluating ALL Osano consent categories together.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Components">
Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components section.
</Step>

<Step title="Add the Component">
Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/osano-consent-mapping` from the list of available components.
</Step>

<Step title="Activate the Component">
Activate the component using the toggle on the top right of the component card.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Setup">
Confirm with "Add component" to complete the setup and begin automatic consent mapping.
</Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

The Osano consent mapping component automatically reads the `osano_consentmanager` cookie that Osano sets on your website. This cookie contains encrypted consent information that includes various consent categories:

- **ESSENTIAL**: Necessary functionality
- **ANALYTICS**: Tracking and analytics consent
- **MARKETING**: Marketing and advertising consent
- **PERSONALIZATION**: Personalization and customization consent
- **STORAGE**: Local storage consent

<Note>
The component evaluates **ALL** consent categories together to determine the overall consent status. This ensures comprehensive privacy compliance by respecting user choices across all consent types.
</Note>

### How the Component Works

The component automatically:

1. Reads the `osano_consentmanager` cookie from user requests
2. Processes the cookie data to extract consent preferences
3. Maps the consent categories to Edgee's consent model

### Consent Mapping

The component maps individual Osano category values as follows:

| Osano Category Value | Interpreted As |
|---------------------|----------------|
| `ACCEPT`            | `granted`      |
| `DENY`              | `denied`       |
| Missing or invalid  | `pending`      |

**Final Status Determination:**

| Scenario | Final Edgee Consent |
|----------|--------------------|
| Any category denied | `denied` |
| Any category pending (none denied) | `pending` |
| All categories granted | `granted` |
| No cookie or invalid data | `pending` |


## Configuration

No additional configuration is required for this component. The consent mapping works automatically once the component is activated in your Edgee project.

<Tip>
Make sure your Osano consent management platform is properly configured on your website before activating this component. The component relies on the presence of the `osano_consentmanager` cookie.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Consent mapping not working correctly">
**Possible causes:**
- Domain name mismatch between Edgee configuration and Osano setup
- Cookie encryption issues

**Solution:** Ensure your Edgee project's frontend hostname matches the domain where Osano is deployed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Consent showing as denied when some categories are granted">
**This is expected behavior.** The component uses a priority-based system where:
- ANY denied category results in overall `denied` consent
- This ensures comprehensive privacy compliance

**To debug:**
1. Check which specific categories are denied in your Osano dashboard
2. Verify that users have granted consent for ALL required categories
3. Remember that essential functionality might still work even with `denied` consent
</Accordion>

## Privacy Compliance

This component helps maintain privacy compliance by:
- Automatically respecting user consent choices made through Osano
- Ensuring consistent consent enforcement across all Edgee components
- Supporting Osano's "$500,000 No Fines, No Penalties" guarantee through proper consent handling

<Warning>
Always ensure your Osano implementation complies with applicable privacy regulations in your jurisdiction. This component only maps existing consent data and does not handle the consent collection process itself.
</Warning>
