[Cookiebot](https://www.cookiebot.com/) helps you collect user consent on your website and comply with international data privacy regulations.

This component automatically handles consent management by integrating directly with Cookiebot, eliminating the need to manually [specify consent](/services/consent/overview) through the Edgee SDK or Data Layer.

The consent status will be automatically set to `pending`, `granted`, or `denied` based on the Cookiebot cookie.

## Getting Started

**To integrate Cookiebot Consent Mapping into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/cookiebot-consent-mapping` from the list of available components.
3. Activate the component on the top right.
4. Confirm with "Add component" to complete the setup.
