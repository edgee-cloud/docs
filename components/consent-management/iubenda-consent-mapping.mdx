description: Integrate user consent managed by Iubenda with your Edgee components.

import EdgeeSdk from '/snippets/edgee-sdk.mdx';

<EdgeeSdk />

[Iubenda](https://www.iubenda.com/) provides a comprehensive consent management solution to help you comply with global privacy regulations and manage user preferences.

This component automatically handles consent management by integrating directly with Iubenda, eliminating the need to [manually specify consent](/services/consent/overview) through the Edgee SDK or Data Layer.

The consent status will be automatically set to `pending`, `granted`, or `denied` based on the Iubenda cookie.

## Getting Started

**To integrate Iubenda Consent Mapping into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/iubenda-consent-mapping` from the list of available components.
3. Activate the component on the top right.
4. Confirm with "Add component" to complete the setup.
