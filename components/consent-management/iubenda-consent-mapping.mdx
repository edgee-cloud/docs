[Iubenda](https://www.iubenda.com/) provides a comprehensive consent management solution to help you comply with global privacy regulations and manage user preferences.

This component automatically handles consent management by integrating directly with Iubenda, eliminating the need to [manually specify consent](/services/consent/overview) through the Edgee SDK or Data Layer.

The consent status will be automatically set to `pending`, `granted`, or `denied` based on the Iubenda cookie.

## Getting Started

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
