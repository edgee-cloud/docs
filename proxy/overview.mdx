Edgee Proxy is designed to transform how workloads and data are
processed across the internet.

Edgee Proxy empowers developers to use, build and deploy **wasm components** operating at the edge.
This approach harnesses the potential of edge computing, enabling workloads to run closer to users than ever before.

Our proxy is cross-platform, whether your application is hosted on **AWS**, **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or any other cloud provider,
whether your application is written in **Javascript**, **Ruby**, **PHP**, **Python**, or any other language,
you can enhance it with Edgee Proxy.

By minimizing the distance data has to travel, Edgee Proxy significantly **reduces latency**, boosts **performance**, and
ensures greater **privacy** and **compliance** with data protection regulations.

## Bye bye greedy SDKs - Hello Components!

Have you ever hesitated to install a client-side SDK due to concerns about stability, performance, or data privacy? **Edgee is here to change the game!**

- **Our Mission:** We are pioneering a new ecosystem where traditional client-side libraries become secure components that operate at the edge network layer. We use the [WebAssembly Component Model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/) to redefine how
technologies like Google Analytics, Amplitude, Segment, and AB Tasty are integrated into your applications.

- **Transforming SDKs into Components:** With Edgee, every SDK becomes a 'Component' that executes at the edge, rather than on your user’s device.
This shift not only enhances performance but also ensures compliance and privacy by design.

- **Commitment to Excellence:** We are dedicated to upholding the highest standards of performance, privacy, and compliance.
With Edgee, each interaction is processed legally, securely, and in real time.

- **Benefits of Moving to the Edge:** By relocating intensive and sensitive tasks from browsers and mobile apps to the edge network,
Edgee leverages distributed processing power. This transition results in faster execution, reduced network congestion, and enhanced application performance.

Edgee is more than just a platform; it represents a paradigm shift in web technology and data processing. Welcome to the cutting edge!
