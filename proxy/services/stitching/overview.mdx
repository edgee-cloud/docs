With *Stitching*, you can integrate advanced A/B testing and feature experimentation platforms while serving all scripts, configurations, and API calls as first-party resources from your domain. Our stitching service integrates seamlessly with leading experimentation platforms, starting with **Kameleoon**, eliminating third-party resource blocking and improving performance.

## How does Stitching work?

Stitching acts as a first-party proxy for your experimentation platform, serving all resources from your domain instead of third-party servers. Experiment configurations are cached at the edge and served instantly, while the actual experiment logic runs client-side using the platform's native SDKs and engines.

## Key Benefits

### First-Party Resource Serving
All experimentation platform resources are served from your domain, providing several advantages:

- **Adblock resistance**: First-party resources are less likely to be blocked by privacy tools and adblockers
- **Enhanced performance**: Eliminates cross-origin requests and DNS lookups to third-party domains  
- **Improved reliability**: Reduces dependency on external CDNs and third-party availability

### Edge-Cached Configurations
- **Instant configuration access**: Experiment configurations are pre-cached at edge locations
- **Reduced client-side loading time**: No need to fetch configurations from third-party servers on page load
- **Frequent updates**: Configurations refresh as often as every 10 minutes, ensuring latest experiment settings
- **Zero flicker potential**: Faster configuration loading reduces visual flicker in experiments

### Improved Test Accuracy
- **Higher participation rates**: Fewer blocked requests mean more users can participate in experiments
- **Bot filtering**: Leverage Edgee's proprietary bot detection for cleaner experiment data
- **Consistent experience**: Reliable first-party serving ensures consistent experiment delivery

## Use Cases

### E-commerce Optimization
- Test product page layouts, checkout flows, and pricing strategies
- Personalize content based on user segments without third-party blocking issues
- Run promotional campaigns with reliable experiment delivery

### Content Personalization  
- Deliver personalized landing pages based on traffic source
- Test different content variations with faster configuration loading
- Optimize conversion funnels with reduced flicker and improved performance

### Feature Rollouts
- Gradually roll out new features to specific user percentages
- Implement kill switches with faster configuration updates
- Test infrastructure changes with reliable first-party serving

## Technical Implementation

Stitching leverages Edgee's edge computing infrastructure to provide:

- **First-party resource serving**: All experimentation platform assets are served from your domain
- **Edge-based configuration caching**: Experiment configurations are cached at edge locations for instant access
- **High availability**: Redundant edge infrastructure ensures consistent resource delivery
- **Real-time updates**: Configuration changes propagate to edge cache within minutes

<Warning>
Stitching requires the Edgee SDK to be installed on your website. The service acts as a first-party proxy for your existing experimentation platform, enhancing delivery without changing your experiment logic.
