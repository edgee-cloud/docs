After setting up your preferred consent management method (either through the Edgee SDK or Consent Mapping Components), 
you need to understand how Edgee interprets and applies different consent statuses. This guide explains the three possible 
consent statuses and how they affect data collection and anonymization in your components.

There are three possible consent statuses:

- `pending`: Initial status when user hasn't made a choice yet
- `denied`: User has explicitly denied consent
- `granted`: User has explicitly granted consent

## Default Consent

If no consent is explicitly set:
- The default consent status is `pending`
- Or, you can configure the default consent status for each component in the Edgee Console

## Data Anonymization

The consent status affects how Edgee handles user data:

1. When consent is `granted`:
   - Data anonymization is disabled
   - Full user data is collected and forwarded to components

2. When consent is `pending` or `denied`:
   - Data anonymization is enabled by default
   - Sensitive user data is anonymized before being forwarded (see [Privacy Documentation](/introduction/privacy))
   - But you can override this behavior by clicking on `Anonymization` button in the component configuration.

## What do components with consent status do?

Each component can have different behavior based on the consent status. Some components will simply do nothing with it, 
and some will adapt their rules. 
For example, the **Piano Analytics** component will activate an "exempt" mode when consent is denied or pending. 
**Google Analytics** will change some of its query parameters (for example, `npa` to `1` and `gcs` to `G101`) when consent is denied or pending.

To know more about how each component works with consent status, please refer to each component's documentation.

## Best Practices

1. Always set explicit consent based on user choice
2. Configure appropriate default consent for each component
3. Only disable anonymization when absolutely necessary
4. Review privacy implications when changing consent settings
5. Document consent collection in your privacy policy
