description: How to override cache for your Edgee project

---

Force Edgee to cache specific paths, whether the cache is enabled or not. These rules take precedence over the default cache 
settings and will help you improve performance.

Cache rules allow you to define how requests are cached based on their path and request/response headers. 
Each rule consists of a path pattern and caching behavior. Rules are evaluated in order, with the first matching rule being applied. 
If no rules match, the default caching behavior is used.

## Activate or disable caching

Browse to your project's **Performance** panel and select **Override cache**.

From here, you can add cache rules to your project.

## Rule Evaluation

Rules are evaluated in the following order:

1. Rules are sorted by their `rank` value (lower ranks are evaluated first)
2. For each rule, the path pattern is checked against the request URL
3. If the path matches, request conditions are evaluated
4. If all conditions are met, the rule is applied
5. If no rule matches, the default caching behavior is used

### Path Matching

Rules can match paths in two ways:

- **Exact Match**: When `Regex` is false, the rule's path must exactly match the request URL path
- **Regex Match**: When `Regex` is true, the rule's path is treated as a regular expression pattern

    />
</Frame>

### Rule Conditions

Rules can include conditions that must be met for the rule to apply:

#### Request Conditions
- **Cookies**: Check for presence, absence, or specific values of cookies
- **Headers**: Check for presence, absence, or specific values of headers
- **Query Parameters**: Check for presence, absence, or specific values of query parameters
- **HTTP Methods**: Restrict the rule to specific HTTP methods

#### Response Conditions
- **Status Codes**: Restrict caching to specific HTTP status codes
- **Headers**: Check for presence, absence, or specific values of response headers

## Caching Behavior

When a rule matches, it can control caching in several ways:

### Cache Control
- **TTL (Time To Live)**: How long the response should be cached (in seconds)
- **Stale While Revalidate (SWR)**: How long a stale response can be served while revalidating
- **Pass Through**: Skip caching entirely for matching requests
- **Erase Set-Cookie**: Remove or keep `Set-Cookie` headers from cached responses

## Response Headers

Edgee adds the following headers to responses to indicate caching behavior:

- `x-edgee-override-cache: yes` - Response was cached according to the rule
- `x-edgee-override-cache: no(set-cookie-present)` - Response wasn't cached due to Set-Cookie headers
- `x-edgee-override-cache: no(resp-condition-not-met)` - Response conditions weren't met
- `x-edgee-override-cache: no(req-condition-not-met)` - Request conditions weren't met
- `x-edgee-override-cache: no(pass)` - Rule specified pass-through

## Example Configuration

<Frame caption="Cache rule example">
    <img
        src="/images/cache-rule-example.png"
        alt="Cache rule example"
    />
</Frame>

This example:
1. Matches all paths starting with `/static/`
2. Only applies to GET requests
3. Only caches responses with status code 200
4. Only caches responses with a `content-type` header with value "text/css"
5. Caches responses for 1 hour (3600 seconds)
6. Allows serving stale content for up to 24 hours (86400 seconds) while revalidating
