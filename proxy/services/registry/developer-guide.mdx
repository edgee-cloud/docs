This guide provides an overview of creating components for the Edgee Component Registry.

Before diving into development, we highly recommend reviewing these [foundational concepts](./foundations).

Edgee supports two types of components: [data collection](/proxy/services/registry/developer-guide-data-collection)
and [edge function](/proxy/services/registry/developer-guide-edge-function) components.

The following steps will help you set up the Edgee CLI and authenticate with your Edgee account,
which is essential for developing and managing components (both types).


## Install and configure the Edgee CLI

### Step 1: Install the CLI

First, install the Edgee CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```shell install script
$ curl https://install.edgee.ai | sh
$ ./edgee --version
```

```shell homebrew
$ brew tap edgee-ai/cli
$ brew install edgee
$ edgee --version
```

```shell cargo binstall
$ cargo binstall edgee
```

```shell build from source (Rust)
$ git clone https://github.com/edgee-ai/cli.git
$ cd cli
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/edgee-cli --version
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Authentication

Second, log in using the token from your Edgee account (you can [create one here](https://www.edgee.ai/~/me/settings/tokens)):

<CodeGroup>

```shell Simple login
$ edgee login
? Your default browser will be opening to Edgee's API token creation page. Do you want to continue? (Y/n)
? Enter Edgee API token (press Ctrl+R to toggle input display): **********
[You can create one at https://www.edgee.ai/~/me/settings/tokens]
Logged as Your name (email@example.com)
```

```shell Using profiles
$ edgee login --profile test
? Your default browser will be opening to Edgee's API token creation page. Do you want to continue? (Y/n)
? Enter Edgee API token (press Ctrl+R to toggle input display): **********
[You can create one at https://www.edgee.ai/~/me/settings/tokens]
Logged as Your name (email@example.com)
```

```shell Using env variable
$ export EDGEE_API_TOKEN=XYZ
```

</CodeGroup>

Verify that the API is working correctly using this token:

<CodeGroup>

```shell Simple login
$ edgee whoami
Logged in as:
  ID:    XYZ-XYZ-DYZ
  Name:  Your name
  Email: your@email.com
  Url:   https://api.edgee.app
```

```shell Using profiles
# this also works with the push command
$ edgee whoami --profile test
Logged in as:
  ID:    XYZ-XYZ-DYZ
  Name:  Your name
  Email: your@email.com
  Url:   https://api.edgee.app
  Profile: test
```

```shell Using env variable
# $EDGEE_API_TOKEN is used for all commands
$ edgee whoami
Logged in as:
  ID:    XYZ-XYZ-DYZ
  Name:  Your name
  Email: your@email.com
  Url:   https://api.edgee.app
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Note: the credentials location depends on your operating system.

  On Linux, it's under `$HOME/.config/edgee`.

  On macOS, it's under `$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/edgee`.

  On Windows, it's under `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}\edgee`.
</Note>

## Optional commands and configurations

#### How to upgrade CLI version

Depending on your installation method, you can upgrade to the latest version/release as follows:

<CodeGroup>

```shell install script
$ edgee self-update
```

```shell homebrew
$ brew update
$ brew install edgee
```

```shell cargo binstall
$ cargo binstall edgee
```

```shell build from source (Rust)
$ cd edgee
$ git pull
$ cargo build --release
```

</CodeGroup>

#### How to get CLI help

If you need guidance on a given command or sub-command, check out the `help` command:

```shell
$ edgee help
Usage: edgee <COMMAND>
Commands:
  login                      Log in to the Edgee Console
  whoami                     Print currently login informations
  components                 Components management commands [aliases: component]
  serve                      Run the Edgee server [aliases: server]
  self-update                Update the Edgee executable
  generate-shell-completion  Print auto-completion script for your shell init file
  help                       Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

You can also use it to explore available sub-commands:

```shell
$ edgee help components
Usage: edgee components <COMMAND>
Commands:
  build  Compile the component in the current directory into Wasm
  check  Check if the local Wasm file file is valid
  init   Initialize a new manifest file in the current directory
  list   List components you previously pulled (coming soon)
  new    Create component in a new directory with sample code
  pull   Pull a component from the Edgee Component Registry (coming soon)
  push   Push a component to the Edgee Component Registry
  test   Run the component in the current folder with sample events
```

Or command-specific options:

```shell
$ edgee help components test
Usage: edgee components test [OPTIONS]
Options:
  --settings <SETTINGS>            Comma-separated key=value pairs for settings
  --settings-file <SETTINGS_FILE>  File containing the settings
  --event-type <EVENT_TYPE>        The event type you want to test [possible values: page, track, user]
  --display-input                  Whether to log the full input event or not (false by default)
  --curl                           Will print to stdout the cURL command for your EdgeeRequest
  --make-http-request              Will automatically make an HTTP request for your EdgeeRequest
```

Alternatively, use `--help` or `-h`.

#### How to enable auto-completion

The Edgee CLI can generate completions for all commands and sub-commands.

```shell
$ edgee generate-shell-completion [SHELL]
# supported value: bash, elvish, fish, powershell, zsh
```

If no argument it passed, the CLI will try to guess the shell type based on the environment.

To install the completions, source them in your shell init file:

<CodeGroup>

```shell bash
# ~/.bashrc
$ eval $(edgee generate-shell-completion bash)
```

```shell zsh
# store the auto-completion in ~/.zsh/_edgee
$ edgee generate-shell-completion zsh > ~/.zsh/_edgee

# ~/.zshrc
fpath=(~/.zsh $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit -u
# note: you might need to delete ~/.zcompdump/ first
```

```shell fish
# ~/.config/fish/completions/edgee.fish
$ edgee generate-shell-completion fish | source
```

```shell elvish
$ edgee generate-shell-completion elvish >> ~/.config/elvish/rc.elv
```

```shell powershell
> edgee generate-shell-completion powershell >> $profile
> .$profile
```

</CodeGroup>
