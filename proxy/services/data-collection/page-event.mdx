The `page` event lets you record whenever a user visits a page, along with any optional properties about the page.
Each time Edgee collects a `page` event, it sends the data to the analytics components you've previously set up in your Edgee project.

## Event fields

The `page` event collects several fields about the page (all optional):

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---
`name` | String | The name of the page
`category` | String | The category of the page
`title` | String | The title of the page
`url` | String | The full url of the page, with scheme, host, path, and search
`path` | String | The path of the page
`search` | String | The search query of the page
`referrer` | String | The referrer of the page (full URL)
`keywords` | Array | The keywords associated with the page
`properties` | Object | Free-form dictionary of properties of the page


## How to collect the `page` event?

### 1 - Automatically

If you followed the [Data Collection Highlights](/proxy/services/data-collection/overview), 
you've already installed the [Edgee SDK](/proxy/getting-started/sdk) on your website.

Once you've installed it, Edgee collects the `page` event for each page viewed,
setting the values of the above fields from the HTTP request or DOM. 


### 2 - Manually

In some cases, manually triggering the `page` event is necessary to accurately collect user movements across different views. 
Edgee’s SDK facilitates this through the `edgee.page()` method, allowing developers to send `page` events with custom data 
whenever a user navigates to a new part of the application. 

Here’s an example of how to manually trigger a `page` event:

```js
window.addEventListener('edgee:loaded', function(){
    edgee.page();
});
```

If you call the `edgee.page()` method without any parameters, Edgee will use the [fields gathering](#fields-gathering) strategy described below.
But to keep the data collection under your control, you can specify the fields directly in the method.

Here is an example of a complete `edgee.page()` call:

```javascript
// Syntax: edgee.page(page_obj, components);
edgee.page({
    "name": "page-name",
    "category": "my-category",
    "title": "Hello world!",
    "url": "https://www.example.com/welcome.html",
    "path": "/welcome.html",
    "search": "?utm_source=google",
    "keywords": ["hello", "world"],
    "properties": {
        "section": "political"
    }
}, {
    "edgee/google-analytics": true,
    "edgee/amplitude": false
});
```

The `edgee.page()` method expect two optionals parameters:

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---
`page_obj` (_optional_) | Object\|String | A dictionary object containing details of the `page` event. This object can include all the following optional fields: `name`, `category`, `title`, `url`, `path`, `search`, `keywords`, and `properties`. You can also provide a string that will be used as the `name` field.
`components` (_optional_) | Object | Specifies which analytics components should receive the event data. This allows for targeted data sending based on your configured components within the Edgee platform.



## Fields gathering

In case you don't specify the fields in the `edgee.page()` function, here's how Edgee gathers the page information:

Field      | Type    | How the value is determined
---------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------
`name`     | String  | Set by the `edgee.page()` function (if provided), otherwise taken from the page’s `<title>` tag.
`category` | String  | Only set if provided in the `page_obj` parameter of the `edgee.page()` function.
`title`    | String  | Set from the `page_obj` parameter if provided, otherwise taken from the page’s `<title>` tag.
`url`      | String  | Set by the `edgee.page()` function (if provided), or else from the `<link rel="canonical">` tag, or finally from the HTTP request.
`path`     | String  | Set from the `page_obj` parameter if provided, otherwise taken from the HTTP request.
`search`   | String  | Set from the `page_obj` parameter if provided, otherwise from the HTTP request.
`keywords` | Array   | Set from the `page_obj` parameter if provided, otherwise from the `<meta name="keywords">` tag.
`properties`| Object | Only defined if provided in the `page_obj` parameter—used as a free-form dictionary of page properties.


## Control the components that will receive the events

If for some reason you don't want to send the `page` event to all the components you've set up in your Edgee project,
you can specify the components that will receive the event data in the `components` parameter of the `edgee.page()` function.

```javascript
// Syntax: edgee.page(page_obj, components);
edgee.page({
    "name": "page-name",
    "category": "my-category",
    "title": "Hello world!",
    "url": "https://www.example.com/welcome.html",
    "path": "/welcome.html",
    "search": "?utm_source=google",
    "keywords": ["hello", "world"],
    "properties": {
        "section": "political"
    }
}, {
    "edgee/google-analytics": true,
    "edgee/amplitude": false
});
```

If the components parameter is not specified, Edgee will send the event to all the components you've set up in your Edgee project.

## Privacy by design

At Edgee, we prioritize user privacy and the protection of personal data. Our approach to handling `page` event data is designed to 
respect user privacy by default, ensuring data is anonymized and processed in compliance with stringent data protection standards.

### Anonymization by default

When processing `page` event data for analytics component, Edgee implements robust data anonymization techniques. These methods 
are designed to remove or alter personally identifiable information (PII), rendering it impossible to trace the data back to any individual. 
Through this process, data is stripped of identifying details, ensuring it cannot be used to track or identify users.

### The Option for PII Transmission

While our standard practice involves anonymizing all `page` event data, we recognize that certain analytics use cases 
may require the transmission of PII. Edgee supports this capability, allowing developers to include PII in `page` events 
if necessary. However, it's crucial to understand the implications:

- **User Consent is Paramount**: Before sending any PII through Edgee, you must obtain explicit consent from the users whose data is being collected. 
This consent should be informed, meaning users are fully aware of what data is collected and how it will be used.

- **Responsibility of the Developer**: If you choose to send PII with `page` events, the responsibility for managing that data in compliance with 
applicable privacy laws rests with you, the Edgee customer. You must ensure that your data collection practices adhere to GDPR, CCPA, or 
any other relevant data protection regulations.

### The need for consent

With anonymization, we guarantee that default `page` data sent to your analytics components cannot be used to identify and track an individual.
Therefore, **you don't need to ask for consent before sending default `page` event data to Edgee, as no personal data is sent**.

To know more about how we handle privacy, check the dedicated [Privacy](/introduction/privacy) documentation.


## Best Practices for `page` Events

- **Rich Context**: The **Data Layer** allows for the specification of comprehensive context data for each event, enhancing the granularity of analytics data captured. Don't hesitate to provide as much information as possible about the page.
- **Manual JS Compatibility**: Edgee’s manual triggering capabilities ensure that you can collect pageviews without the traditional webpage reloads.
- **Flexible Destination Configuration**: Utilize the components parameter to fine-tune where your data is sent, optimizing for relevance and efficiency.
