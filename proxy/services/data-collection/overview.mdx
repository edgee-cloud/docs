With *Data Collection*, you can run your current analytics solution at the edge, 100% privacy-friendly, and without any data loss,
whether it's **Google Analytics**, **Amplitude** or any other analytics tool, and even if it's your own first party analytics solution.

## How to enable data collection?

After [creating your project](/proxy/getting-started/project-settings) and [adding the Edgee SDK to your website](/proxy/getting-started/sdk), Edgee will start capturing all the analytics events at the edge.

First, enable the analytics component for your project by visiting the **Components** panel on your project page, and click **Add a Component**. 
Then select one of the available components and configure it.

</Frame>

## How does it work?

Edgee intercepts the HTTP responses from your backend, and triggers the analytics events directly at the edge, without having to wait for the client to execute any code.

Remember: the Edgee proxy integrates with the analytics provider only when the Edgee SDK is detected on your pages.

Once the SDK is added, Edgee automatically captures `page` events (pageview) at the edge.

In the [next section](/proxy/services/data-collection/page-event) we'll see how to manage the `page` event, and how to manually trigger other events using Edgee SDK.


## Bots

Unlike server-side analytics technology, Edgee is able to detect bots thanks to a proprietary challenge mechanism. 
Our strength lies in being present at the edge, but also on the client side, thanks to our SDK.
This enables us to collect only data from real humans.
