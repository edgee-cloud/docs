Each project is associated with an Edgee-owned domain under `*.edgee.app`.

Your default domain is `your-project-id.edgee.app` and it allows you to get started with Edgee quickly,
without worrying about TLS certificates or infrastructural integrations with your existing architecture.

In many cases, you'll need to create a custom domain so that Edgee handles all requests routed to your website,
such as `my-website.com`.

## Step 1: Create a new domain

Browse to your project's **Settings** panel and select **Domains**.

Here, click **Add domain** on the top right.

    <img
        className="block dark:hidden"
        src="/images/domains-create.png"
        alt="How to create a new domain"
        dark:hidden
    />
    <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/domains-create-dark.png"
        alt="How to create a new domain"
    />
</Frame>

Now simply enter your domain, such as `my-website.com`.

There's no need to select a protocol or any other detail for now.

<Frame caption="Enter the domain name. Click on the image to zoom in.">
    <img
        className="block dark:hidden"
        src="/images/domains-new.png"
        alt="Enter the domain name"
        dark:hidden
    />
    <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/domains-new-dark.png"
        alt="Enter the domain name"
    />
</Frame>

That's it! Click **Save** and let's more forward with the configuration.


## Step 2: SSL certificate

An SSL certificate ensures secure, encrypted communication between your visitors and your website via HTTPS. 
This step verifies that you own the domain you're trying to configure.

**What happens:** Edgee will provide you with a specific CNAME record to add to your DNS configuration. 
This record contains a unique verification token that proves you control the domain.

**Example of what you'll receive:**
> Add the following CNAME record to your DNS zone:
>
> **Name:** `_4E7FF59F3A89BR3D14EBBF0BBE7B3E63.yourdomain.com`  
> **Points to:** `82D845BBE2FDAAD277FB816DE3388AF8FAC9a6d88f39de.secure.com`

**Where to add this:** In your domain registrar's DNS management panel (like Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)

## Step 3: Route traffic to Edgee

After SSL verification is complete and the certificate is installed, you'll need to update your domain's DNS settings 
to route all traffic through Edgee's infrastructure.

**What happens:** You'll receive specific DNS configuration instructions tailored to your domain setup. 
This typically involves updating your domain's A record or CNAME record to point to Edgee's servers.

**Common scenarios:**
- **Root domain (example.com):** Usually requires an A record pointing to Edgee's IP address
- **Subdomain (www.example.com):** Usually requires a CNAME record pointing to Edgee's domain
- **Both root and subdomain:** May require multiple records
