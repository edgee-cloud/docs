The Edgee platform allows you to create **Organizations**, then create projects and invite users into each organization.
This is useful for managing multiple projects, especially if you are working with different teams or clients.

You can create multiple organizations and invite different users to each organization.
This way, you can manage access to your projects more effectively.

Please note that a default organization is created for you when you sign up for Edgee, corresponding to your user name.

You can always find your Organizations and Projects in the top-left menu of the Edgee console.

        src="/images/organizations-menu.png"
        alt="Edgee Organizations & Projects"
        dark:hidden
        width={500}
    />
    <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/organizations-menu-dark.png"
        alt="Edgee Organizations & Projects"
        width={500}
    />

## How to create an organization

To create a new organization, follow these steps:

1. Open the Edgee console and open the top-left menu.
2. Click **Create Organization**.
3. Enter a name and slug for your organization.
4. Click **Continue**.

<Note>
    Note: The slug is a unique identifier for your organization and will be used in the URL.
    It should be unique and not contain any spaces or special characters.
</Note>

    <img
        className="block dark:hidden"
        src="/images/create-organization.png"
        alt="Edgee Organization form"
        dark:hidden
    />
    <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/create-organization-dark.png"
        alt="Edgee Organization form"
    />
</Frame>

Now you're ready to learn more about [inviting users and managing their roles](./user-roles).


## Sub-organizations

Optionally, you can create sub-organizations within your main organization.
This is useful for managing different teams or projects.

For example, it allows the users of your main organization to automatically get access to all
sub-organizations without having to invite them manually.

To create a new sub-organization, follow these steps:

1. Open the Edgee console and open the top-left menu.
2. Click **Create Organization**.
3. Enter a name and slug for your sub-organization.
4. Expand the **Optional fields** section and enable the **Sub Organization** switch.
4. Click **Continue**.


<Note>
    Note: the new sub-organization will be created under the currently highlighted organization.

    Also, there can be only one level of sub-organizations.
    So you won't be able to create a sub-organization under a sub-organization.
