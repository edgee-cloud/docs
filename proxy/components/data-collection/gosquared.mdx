GoSquared helps you grow your business by providing real-time analytics, customer engagement tools, and integrated CRM features. With GoSquared, you can track user behavior, identify leads, and automate communication — all from a single platform.

This component lets you forward analytics data to GoSquared directly from the edge, enabling low-latency event tracking without compromising performance.

## Event Mapping

Here's how Edgee events map to GoSquared:

| Edgee Event | GoSquared Event | Description |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| Page        | `pageview`       | Pageview event with basic page metadata |
| Track       | Your event name  | Custom event name passed through to GoSquared |
| User        | `identify`       | Associates user traits with a person |

## Getting Started

**To integrate GoSquared into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/gosquared` from the list of available components.
3. Enter your GoSquared **API Key** and **Site Token**.
4. Click Save.
5. Once the component has been configured, you are ready to track events via GoSquared from the edge.

## Component Name
