Google Analytics uses a client ID cookie (`_ga`) to track users across sessions. With Ga4 Native Cookies component, 
this cookie can be managed directly at the edge.

To know more about the native cookie support, please refer to the [Native Cookies](/proxy/services/data-collection/native-cookies) documentation.

## Getting Started

**To integrate Google Analytics Native Cookies into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/google-analytics-native-cookies` from the list of available components.
3. In your component settings, configure the mode:

  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/native-cookie-support-light.png"/>
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/native-cookie-support-dark.png"/>
</Frame>

The setting determines when the Google Analytics client ID cookie is set:

- **safe**: Only set cookie after user grants consent (default)
- **strong**: Set cookie unless user explicitly denies consent
- **always**: Set cookie regardless of consent status

<Warning>
  Using `strong` or `always` modes may not comply with privacy regulations in your jurisdiction (such as GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable laws). 
  By enabling these modes, you assume full responsibility for:
  - Ensuring compliance with all applicable privacy laws and regulations
  - Obtaining and managing necessary user consents
  - Implementing appropriate privacy notices and policies
  - Any legal consequences resulting from non-compliant cookie usage

  Edgee provides these features as technical capabilities only. We strongly recommend consulting with your legal team or privacy experts before implementing these modes.
