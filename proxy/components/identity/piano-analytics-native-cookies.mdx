Piano Analytics uses various cookies to track users across sessions. With Piano Analytics Native Cookies component, 
these cookies can be managed directly at the edge.

To know more about the native cookie support, please refer to the [Native Cookies](/proxy/services/data-collection/native-cookies) documentation.

## Getting Started

**To integrate Piano Analytics Native Cookies into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Components.
2. Select "Add a component" and choose `edgee/piano-analytics-native-cookies` from the list of available components.
3. In your component settings, configure the mode:

<Frame caption="Go to your project > Components > Your Piano Analytics Native Cookies component">
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/native-cookie-support-light.png"/>
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/native-cookie-support-dark.png"/>
</Frame>

The setting determines when the Piano Analytics cookies are set:

- **safe**: Only set cookie after user grants consent (default)
- **strong**: Set cookie unless user explicitly denies consent
- **always**: Set cookie regardless of consent status

<Warning>
  Using `strong` or `always` modes may not comply with privacy regulations in your jurisdiction (such as GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable laws). 
  By enabling these modes, you assume full responsibility for:
  - Ensuring compliance with all applicable privacy laws and regulations
  - Obtaining and managing necessary user consents
  - Implementing appropriate privacy notices and policies
  - Any legal consequences resulting from non-compliant cookie usage

  Edgee provides these features as technical capabilities only. We strongly recommend consulting with your legal team or privacy experts before implementing these modes.
</Warning>

4. Additionally, you need to select which cookie type to use:

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/piano-cookie-type-light.png"/>
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/piano-cookie-type-dark.png"/>
</Frame>

- **_pcid**: Piano client side cookie with browser ID (recommended for most use cases)
- **_pcid + _pprv**: Piano client side cookie with browser ID and privacy settings
- **atid**: Simple UUID cookie 
- **atuserid**: Legacy AT Internet cookie

5. Then, you can specify the domain of the cookie (optional):

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/piano-cookie-domain-light.png"/>
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/piano-cookie-domain-dark.png"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
  If you have any doubts about which cookie type to use or the domain of the cookie, please contact us at [support@edgee.com](mailto:support@edgee.com).
