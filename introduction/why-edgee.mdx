Edgee isn't just another proxy. It's purpose-built infrastructure for production AI workloads, combining edge computing, intelligent routing, and zero-trust security in one platform.

## Edge-First Architecture

Traditional AI gateways route all traffic through centralized servers. Edgee processes requests at the edge, closest to your application or user.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request hits nearest edge node">
    Your request arrives at one of 100+ global PoPs within milliseconds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Intelligent routing">
    Our engine selects the optimal model based on cost, performance, or your custom rules.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic failover">
    If a provider fails, we instantly retry with your backup models.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response streams back">
    Results stream directly to your app with full observability logged.
  </Step>
</Steps>


### Global Network

Powered by **Fastly** and **AWS**, our network spans six continents:

<Note>
  Requests are automatically routed to the nearest PoP via Anycast. No configuration needed.

### One Key, All Models

With a single Edgee API key, you get instant access to every supported model; OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and more. No need to manage multiple provider accounts or juggle API keys:

```typescript
const edgee = new Edgee(process.env.EDGEE_API_KEY);

// Access any model with the same key
await edgee.send({ model: 'gpt-4o', input: 'Hello, world!' });
await edgee.send({ model: 'claude-sonnet-4.5', input: 'Hello, world!' });
await edgee.send({ model: 'gemini-3-pro', input: 'Hello, world!' });
```

### Bring Your Own Keys

Need more control? Use your existing provider API keys alongside Edgee. This gives you direct billing relationships, access to custom fine-tuned models, and the ability to use provider-specific features:

```typescript
const edgee = new Edgee({
  apiKey: process.env.EDGEE_API_KEY,
  providers: {
    openai: { apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY },
    anthropic: { apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY },
  },
});

// Requests to OpenAI/Anthropic use YOUR keys
// Other providers fall back to Edgee's unified access
```

You can mix both approaches—use Edgee's unified access for some providers and your own keys for others.
