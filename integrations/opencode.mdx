## Overview

Edgee's OpenAI-compatible API works seamlessly with OpenCode, allowing you to leverage OpenCode's powerful CLI agent capabilities while maintaining control over your LLM infrastructure.

## Configuration

To use Edgee with OpenCode, you need to configure the `opencode.json` configuration file. Open or create `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` and add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  // Theme configuration
  "theme": "opencode",
  "autoupdate": true,
  "provider": {
    "edgee": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "edgee",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://api.edgee.ai/v1",
        "apiKey": "your-edgee-api-key"
      },
      "models": {
        "mistral-small": {
          "name": "mistral small (edgee)"
        },
        "gpt-4": {
          "name": "gpt-4 (edgee)"
        },
        "claude-3-haiku": {
          "name": "claude 3 haiku (edgee)"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace `"your-edgee-api-key"` with your actual Edgee API key.

## Usage

Once configured, you can select the configured models directly within the OpenCode CLI interface.

When you launch OpenCode, you will be able to choose from the models you defined in the `models` section of your configuration (e.g., "mistral small (edgee)", "gpt-4 (edgee)", etc.).

## Authentication

Edgee uses standard Bearer token authentication. Your API key configured in `opencode.json` is automatically used to authenticate requests to the Edgee API.
