An edge node is a physical server located at the edge of the network within Edgee's global infrastructure.
It processes your services' workloads closer to your users, reducing latency and improving performance.

Edge nodes are strategically distributed across hundreds of locations worldwide, 
ensuring low latency and high availability for your applications. 
They process requests and data locally, reducing the need to send information back and forth to central servers, 
thus improving performance.
