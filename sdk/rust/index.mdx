The Edgee Rust SDK provides a modern, type-safe, async interface to interact with the Edgee AI Gateway. Built with Rust's powerful type system and async/await capabilities, it offers compile-time safety, zero-cost abstractions, and excellent performance.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install edgee
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use edgee::Edgee;

let client = Edgee::with_api_key("your-api-key");
let response = client.send("gpt-4o", "What is the capital of France?").await.unwrap();

println!("{}", response.text().unwrap_or(""));
// "The capital of France is Paris."
```
