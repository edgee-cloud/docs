Edgee AI Gateway is a **unified, OpenAI-compatible API** that sits between your application and LLM providers.
It’s designed to help teams ship faster while keeping **routing, reliability, observability, and privacy controls** in one place.

<Note>
Edgee AI Gateway is still under active construction. We’re building fast, shipping incrementally, and writing docs in parallel.
If you need something more mature today, jump to the [Edgee Proxy documentation](/proxy/overview).

## What the AI Gateway focuses on

These are the core capabilities we’re designing the gateway around:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Unified API" icon="plug" iconType="duotone" href="/quickstart">
    One integration that can route across providers without rewriting your application logic.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Routing & reliability" icon="route" iconType="duotone">
    Policy-based routing, fallbacks, and safer failure modes when providers rate-limit or degrade.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Observability & cost" icon="chart-line" iconType="duotone">
    The signals you need to run production AI: latency, errors, usage, and cost — exportable and actionable.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Privacy controls" icon="shield" iconType="duotone">
    Configurable logging and retention, plus provider-side ZDR where available.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What to expect (right now)

- **A product in progress**: features and APIs may evolve as we learn from real production use-cases.
- **Clear defaults, configurable controls**: the goal is to reduce “LLM glue code” while keeping you in charge.
- **Docs expanding quickly**: each feature page will get deeper guides, examples, and best practices as we ship.

## Looking for the mature platform?

Edgee Proxy has a large set of production-ready capabilities and much deeper documentation today:

- **Start here**: [Edgee Proxy overview](/proxy/overview)
- **Implementation guides**: [Proxy getting started](/proxy/getting-started/index)
