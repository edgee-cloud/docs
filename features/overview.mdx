Edgee AI Gateway is an **edge-native, cost-optimized AI Gateway** that reduces LLM spending by up to 50% through token compression. Behind a single OpenAI-compatible API, you get access to 200+ models with intelligent routing, reliability, observability, and privacy controls.

<Note>
Edgee AI Gateway is still under active construction. We’re building fast, shipping incrementally, and writing docs in parallel.
Don't hesitate to [contact us](https://www.edgee.cloud/contact) if you have any questions or feedback.

## What to expect (right now)

- **A product in progress**: features and APIs may evolve as we learn from real production use-cases.
- **Clear defaults, configurable controls**: the goal is to reduce “LLM glue code” while keeping you in charge.
- **Docs expanding quickly**: each feature page will get deeper guides, examples, and best practices as we ship.
