description: Run shared tools at the edge so your LLM calls have real capabilities without hard-coding tool glue everywhere.

Edge Tools let you give your LLM calls real capabilities without re-implementing tool glue across every service. **Shared tools** are common capabilities that Edgee runs at the edge (e.g. common primitives).

## Why Edge Tools?

- **Less application glue** — Define tools once at the gateway instead of re-implementing them across services.
- **Lower latency** — Execute tools closer to users and providers to reduce round-trips.
- **Stronger control** — Centralize permissions, audit logs, and safety policies for tool execution.

Your app calls Edgee; when a model requests tool execution, Edgee runs the shared tool at the edge, applies policies, and returns the result. Observability captures the full trace.

## Activation and hydration

1. In the [Edgee Console](https://www.edgee.cloud), open your organization and go to **Tools**.
2. For each tool you want to use, **Activate for organization**. Once activated, the tool is available for all API keys and the org — but **only via the API**: you must send **`edgee_tool_ids`** in the request to use it (see [Manual edgee tool call](#manual-edgee-tool-call) below).
3. Optionally enable **hydration** so the gateway auto-injects the tool definitions:
   - **Hydrate for entire org** — The gateway adds the tool to every request from the organization. You do not need to send `edgee_tool_ids` for that tool; it is injected automatically.
   - **Hydrate for specific API keys** — The gateway adds the tool only for requests using the selected API keys. For those keys, the tool is auto-injected; for others, send `edgee_tool_ids` if the tool is activated.

Only tools that are activated for your API key can be used. If you send **`edgee_tool_ids`** with an ID that is not activated or not allowed for the key, the request returns 400 with `invalid_edgee_tool_ids`.

## Manual edgee tool call

When a tool is **activated** but **not hydrated** for your scope, send **`edgee_tool_ids`** in the completion request body with the list of tool IDs you want (e.g. `["edgee_current_time", "edgee_generate_uuid"]`). Copy the tool ID from the console (click to copy next to each tool). When a tool is **hydrated** for your org or API key, you can omit it from `edgee_tool_ids` — the gateway injects it automatically.

Example with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.edgee.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What time is it in Paris?"}],
    "edgee_tool_ids": ["edgee_current_time"]
  }'
```

Example with the OpenAI-compatible SDK (pass `edgee_tool_ids` in the body when not using hydration):

```javascript
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What time is it in Paris?" }],
  edgee_tool_ids: ["edgee_current_time", "edgee_generate_uuid"],
});
```

If you omit `edgee_tool_ids` (or send an empty array), the gateway injects only tools that have **hydration** enabled for your org or API key. If you send `edgee_tool_ids`, those IDs are validated: any ID that is not activated or not allowed for your API key returns 400 with code `invalid_edgee_tool_ids` and a message listing the invalid IDs.

## Available tools

These shared tools are available today. All Edge Tools use the `edgee_` prefix.

- **`edgee_current_time`** — Get the current date and time in a given timezone (IANA name). Defaults to UTC if not provided.
  Parameters: `timezone` (optional string) — IANA timezone, e.g. `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`, `Asia/Tokyo`.

- **`edgee_generate_uuid`** — Generate a random UUID (v4).
  Parameters: None.

Example: if the model calls `edgee_current_time` with `{"timezone": "Europe/Paris"}`, the gateway returns the current time in Paris. If the model calls `edgee_generate_uuid`, the gateway returns a new UUID.

## Relation to function calling

The [SDK tools documentation](/sdk/typescript/tools) describes how to pass **tools** (function definitions) in each request so the model can request calls — that’s **client-side** function calling. **Edge Tools** are shared tools that run **at the gateway**, so you don’t have to run and wire every tool in your own backend.
